Dude. Stop saying you are not good at things. You are probably the most clear headed and goal oriented 19 yr old I have come across in my life ( including myself). The way you have put your thoughts across and have diagnosed the root cause of your problem, tells me that you have clarity of thought and are capable of conveying that to the other person very well. You are worried about your career prospects and job opportunities at 19. You know what I was worried about when I was 19 - about the Gujarati classmate I had a crush on was dating someone else. LOL!

If I had your clarity of thought and goals when I was 19, I would have gone places in lifeüôÇ. 

For now you gotta do two things

1.	Pick up a hobby. Music, art, games, sports, movies, drama, volunteering or anything else. Only criteria should be that you enjoy it and it shouldn‚Äôt feel like a chore. Find an online community in that area and get yourself involved with the community. Once you have gained some foothold in your hobby, find a real world community in your college that is interested in the hobby. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, try starting one - even if it means 2-3 other people.

2.	 your arrears - your approximate life span is going to be another 50 years at least. Why are you in a hurry to get things done. Slow down and take up 1 arrear per semester. That would allow you to clear them without racking up more. There is a good probability you ll rack up a few more. But always focus on taking up just 1 arrear per semester. I have had friends clear 20+ arrears and then go on to become successful people in life. Life is long and slow. Don‚Äôt think that you are slow. Because ones journey can be slow only if there is an end goal. But the end goal is the journey itself. So slow or fast is not really a thing. It is all just relative 

3.	if you don‚Äôt think you want to be a software engineer, then don‚Äôt. You seem to have a pretty good handle with writing and conveying messages. I think someone else also suggested product/program management and project management roles for you. Consider them. You don‚Äôt need a special degree for them. You need to be organized, be able to communicate effectively, be able to write well and be able to convince people. I believe you are capable of all these qualities. Seriously consider product management roles. They are HOT! And some of the biggest names in the world worked as product managers ( including Sundar Pichai)

Finally - 

We all came from the same star dust and we will all go back to the same stars. The point of life is to live. Watch this interview by Brian Cox - he explains what is the point of a finite life in an infinite universe. It is to live. The statistical chance of creation of human life in an empty cold universe is about 1 in a billion or something. The probability of you being born is again a 1 in billion. So take advantage of this life and live it. 

I can't give you an advice on your life or judge you but my advice will take care of your mental health if you follow it.

College is not the end of life. Mental health is a real issue and many people don't take it seriously. 

My advice to people in your age is to stop masturbation.(most do it, sorry if you don't have the habit) You can get help from r/nofap. 

Go to a nearby gym 3-4 days a week and you will get a supernatural confidence, make that your hobby. These negative thoughts are not yourself but mind games.

Suicidal tendencies and depression are games of the mind and Suicide is not a solution, it will give more pain to your parents. Imagine, do you want to give more pain to yourself and your parents.

I repeat, go to a gym and no fap, it will change everything

Bro Ida patha en carrear nybagam varudu like that only i did my engineering first sem all clear second sem 1 3 Rd and 4 th sem wash out. Enakum ena nadakudu valkayla therela just confidence build Pani daily padichen 5 th sem and like free time arrear exam padichen class listen panen apdiye out of 11 arrear na 6 clear panen and 5 th sem 1 vilunduchu 6 th sem 4 paper clear panen  7 th all panen na off campus nalla company place ayten just confidence build Pani daily padinga intrest edutu nenga podura effort engayavadu use agum valkayla.

Just take a resolution that u will never ever even think about harming yourself in ANY manner again. It's difficult. But read what you have written. Look at the number of instances where you have thought about harming yourself. 

No, your life is not over. It's not over until you think it is over. 

Here's my favourite quote from my favourite teacher:

"If you think you can do something, you might do it. If you think you can't do it, you are right! ". 

Also, working for a startup is not a bad idea at all. All i can say is, don't have a closed mindset towards anything. Try exploring! 

The only attitude you should have towards life is "enna nadandhaalum paathukalam". If you need to share anything, feel free to ping me.

Lots of great advice in this thread. But remember thambi, you are doing so, SO well. 

You speak harshly about yourself and blame yourself even when you were going through serious mental health issues as a CHILD. Depression, anxiety, and addiction (including phone addiction) are medical issues that deserve treatment even if it was not available to you. It is NOT your fault that your parents are emotionally abusive to you, even if they tell you that it‚Äôs your fault. Thappa nanachikaada, our parents did the best they could with what they know. But it seems your parents (just like mine) are not equipped to raise kids in the 21st century, where independence and believing in yourself are keys to success in the business world no matter what industry. Forgive them for what they did not know. Forgive YOURSELF for doing the best you fucking could under the circumstances, even if you tripped and fell sometimes along the way. 

Kanna, you became a legal adult only recently, so let me tell you the secret of success ‚Äî forgiving yourself for your mistakes, loving yourself unconditionally, and parenting yourself. And when I say ‚Äúparenting‚Äù, I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúcriticizing yourself over every little mistake‚Äù. You have to remind yourself that you have character defects just like every other human being ‚Äî but you are NOT a defective character. YOU are not a failure, you are a work in progress that faces successes and failures. 

Self-love sounds like some easy flowery shit, but seriously it is my biggest challenge. Andha self-love journey kashtamaa irukkum, aana adhula thaan vaazhkai thripthi aa irukkum. Your sense of joy and happiness can ONLY come from within yourself, NOT from someone or something else. Your parents, friends, or romantic partners cannot give you true joy even if they love you. You can‚Äôt find true fulfillment in a diploma or exam result. Job la irukkaadhu, college admission la irukkaadhu, panam la irukkaadhu, pills la irukkaadhu, sarakku la irukkaadhu, phone la irukkaadhu, inspirational youtube video la irukkaadhu, kovil/mosque/church layum irukkaadhu. Even if all of these things feel good for a moment, when they leave you and you are alone with nothing and no one but yourself ‚Äî do you love yourself even then? Do you love the swami/God/Allah/holiness/spirit that YOU are?

Self-love is a journey, not a destination. Don‚Äôt give up because you are not there yet. Us internet strangers don‚Äôt want you to give up. Nee ippa thaan un vaazhkai e arambikkara, only now have you started writing the story of your life. You have sooooo much time ahead of you, even if you decided to fuck off for a year and do absolutely nothing!

Thambi you are going to be just fine. Don‚Äôt listen to what ignorant people say about missing the boat ‚Äî life is about building your own fucking boat and setting sail. Someday in the future, maybe you‚Äôll look back at today and congratulate yourself for making it through this tough time. At the very least, know that I am congratulating YOU right now for being here today after all you‚Äôve been through. Come give us an update on all the fun things you‚Äôre doing later.

Hey bro, please don‚Äôt think about anything extreme. I know it‚Äôs hard to understand how this situation will pass at this time. But ithuvum kadanthu pogum. 

IT industry is chaotic by its very nature. You would think everything is fine but very next hour, you will be hit by production bug or something that will disrupt your rhythm and have you jump through hoops to get something or other working. As an engineer working in IT, impostor syndrome is very real and couple that with depression, sometimes I feel stuck in a cage struggling to breathe. But I have a family and I have to go on for them and I do. Sometimes I wish mental health was taken seriously in India but it is not. 

If I may offer a suggestion, just take any job at this time. You may have to suffer through work, particularly in startups but it will get you away from your family and will give you sense of independence. At the very least, you don‚Äôt have to put up with abuse from your family. 

Try taking life one day at a time. I always listen to, ‚Äúoru naalil vaazhkai‚Äù from puthupettai on a loop when I feel dark. Find a song that does the same for you. If you can‚Äôt don‚Äôt worry. Not the end of the world. Just breathe and remember, ‚ÄúIthuvum kadanthu pogum‚Äù.

don't compare yourself with others mate, also don't get jealous looking at your friends, life is not fair, it will never going to be fair, so stop bitching about yourself, try to clear the papers and get a degree.

threatening your parents going to work for one or two times, but not going to work all the time. Instead, it makes them prepare for the worst. so stop doing that shit.

I was not gonna comment here since you already got really good people helping you out here. But I remember when my younger sister called me in the middle of the night and cried for 10 mins straight and ended the call. The next day she told me she was staring at a knife in front of her and didn't know what to do. She was bit older than you, 21 I guess. She was in PG, all alone, away from home. She was in college, SRM doing MBA. All her friends lived together in an apartment. So she was truly alone. I am not one to answer calls usually, never at nights. But I am glad I picked it up that night. 

So this is what I'll tell you. Sweetie, it doesn't matter who you are with, where you are. My family is fucked up too. I have two sisters and none of the choices I made till after college was our own. And all three of us have had thoughts like you at some point or the other.  It's easy to succumb to these issues when you are young and you feel alone.

You need to find one person, or a few people if you're lucky, you can count on. Someone who's been there for you, who will be there for you. No one else matters, their opinions, their lives don't matter. Their advice, how good their lives are, their problems. 

You hate your parents what they've done and what they haven't. It's okay. Don't ruin your life because of that. After the first 21 years, your life is yours if you know how to navigate in our society. If you can stand up to your family, you can have the life you always wanted. You can't change people who don't want to change. You can't expect love from someone who's got none left to give. 

As far college, I know people who had helluva backlogs and cleared them in one go after college ended. You will have time, sweetie. Trust me. It's about one step a time. You want to clear your arrears now, focus on it. If you want to land a job, focus on just that. If you want to develop your skills, that's what you do. You do everything at once, you'll be overwhelmed.

You can have the job you want if you know what you exactly want. I did engineering too, something I was forced to do. A lot of my friends never got into IT field, even remotely engineering. I got into data visualisation. It depends on what you're interested in.

The job market is kinda mess right now. But you'll find your way. Most people you see and wonder how they got their life together, trust me, they haven't. They are muscling through. They are winging it as they go.

So that's what you do. Have an idea of what you want in life. Build from there. You'll realise all this school, college, marks, none of it matters after a couple of years. It'll take time to get there, but you will.

I also hope you find a good therapist and get the necessary help you need. I think you do.

Love.

Hey man!! You ok bro now?? Please update

[removed]

ü´Ç

Seems like you're quite tough , so stay as one .

Stay Strong and all the best .

*DONT BLAME *  DON'T REGRET  * DON'T LOOK BACK * 

( Cry now and then , anger is better than phenyl)

You are a very intelligent guy. Have faith in yourself that you will succeed in life. Unfortunately intelligent guys will become outcast during college years, because no one might understand you.

You think differently,which is good

Don‚Äôt let anyone (even your parents) downgrade you.Remember you can‚Äôt change your parents‚Äô mindset, because they are hard wired like that.

Efforts to commit suicide will be seen as cowardliness to your parents, they won‚Äôt trust you or understand you if you do that.

There is still morrrrreeee timw for you to succeed in life.chill.

Do you have sibilings?? Sometimes talking to them will make you feel better.

You have few things going for you.

1. Very good English. Most kids from tier-3 cities have serious disadvantage here.

2. Common sense, and clarity in your thoughts

3. Intelligent

Once you complete your degree and get into a job, nobody cares about your backlogs, 10th/12th marks, even degree marks. These only matter if you want to do PG.

Somethings you should aim for:

1. Finish your degree in 4 years. Doesn't matter if you have backlogs in between as long as you finish in 4 years. 

2. Find out what you are good at. Most kids in ECE typically go into IT field. If that is your aim, figure out some area in IT you are interested in and train yourself rigorously. This is more important than getting good marks in the degree. Same applies even if you want to go non-IT.

3. Your college might have "okay" placement, but may not be great. But if you are technically sound, you don't even need college placement to get a job. You can find it yourself. You just need initiative. Find companies you are interested in and apply for internship. These are easier to get than jobs. If you can impress your managers in internship, you will be offered job. You can also do freelance work (or even free work) which will gain you experience.

4. Don't let your parents rail you up. Concentrate on yourself and your career, rest will automatically fall in place.

I literally have experienced all that you did, except that mine started in 11th. Topper in 10th, emotionally unavailable parents, phone addiction began in 11th, flunked my 11th exams, was asked to leave my school midway in 12th as I could not clear my exams, cut myself, drank Harpic, my parents said the same shit, got into a mediocre school somehow and got 75% in 12th, got into a mediocre arts college.

I used to get panic attacks everytime I was facing an exam and I'd skip some of my internals. After explaining my situation to my professors, some of them were understanding and helped me retake my tests. It was then that I realised that I should take my life in my control and studied hard and got the third rank. For my PG, I got into one of the reputed arts college in Chennai and was among the top five there as well. 

I still continue to live with my parents who are extremely emotionally abusive, manipulative always gaslighting me and blackmailing me. I'm trying to find a job in a different city but I'm not able to. But I won't stop trying to because my urge to leave the house will always continue to push me forward. So, maybe you can try keeping that as a motive and study hard, clear your backlogs and find a job elsewhere. Don't bow down to your parents if they are abusive, please! It'll be the biggest thing you do to yourself, so please, don't listen to them.

Dude ,i know of a friend who cleared his arrears after 5 years and he's made his way to working in an American company, you'll be fine don't worry after sometime you realise that all the things that you were afraid of weren't even that big of a thing 

Pick up some. Good hobbies ,gym , musical instruments and read books, been reading this book called atomic habits and its given me such a different perspective,

What i can say for sure is you're just 19 and you have all the opportunity to go figure out the world so don't put yourself down and remember the true worth of a man is not where he stands in times of comfort but during times of adversity..

Seeing your post I don't think your parents are abusive or not supportive, but you just being toxic and wasting away time. Talk with them instead of getting addicted to phone or doing stupid stuff to seek attention. If they're buying you everything you want, they will talk but you need to listen first.

Go see a good psychology counselor because your entire post is basically "I am a spoiled jealous brat ruining my life not putting efforts".

I hope your parents will forgive your toxic nature and arrange  for CBT and proper medication .

If you can DM me I'll suggest a good therapist, they charge around 1k per session and it's over Google meet only but worth every penny. You need a safe space to overcome your emotions, that's all,  you will find everything falls into place once you're in control.

And bro, one more help. Apart from this project manager, content writer or copy writer, are there any other professions for writing and usage of words. 

I blindly wanted to jump on the IT bandwagon cos there's this societal hype and I was always afraid that I would never be able to make the same amount of money as people of non-IT jobs do. 

Not to mention, I always longed for a liberal friends group and heard that IT offices have mostly liberal circles. So, that's another reason why I badly wanna move abroad.

>You are probably the most clear headed and goal oriented 

Really? My staffs and teachers have always told me that I look confused, as if my mind is preoccupied with some other thoughts while I should be focusing on something else, for the most part, they aren't wrong tho. I constantly dissociate towards daydreaming activities so, that might be giving people the confused look of face, which I usually give. 

Sometimes it's out of my control. 

>Pick up a hobby

I was actually planning to do it after I graduate, as I thought to myself that I wouldn't have time for that kinda stuff and I must first get myself a job and move out then, look forward to picking up any hobbies, if possible.  

>But always focus on taking up just 1 arrear per semester. 

Per sem ku 1 panradhuku badhila... Time kedaikaradha poruththu yevlo arrears paper oru sem padika mudiyumo adha padichite poi yeludhaaamla... Cos time efficient plus thali vali irukaadhu (again time kedaikuradhus poruththu Naa solren) 

>You seem to have a pretty good handle with writing and conveying messages. 

Thanks. Ever since my school days, my friends and staffs have always complimented me for my essay writing and usage of words. I always think of improving my writing, by improving vocabulary and introduce new words into my writing. 

I do make grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes while writing sometimes tho. 

When it comes to speaking in English tho, I lose my shit. I can understand if somebody with a native English speaking accent or any other accent with that regard spoke to me. 

I kinda get nervous whenever I hear customer care calls in English, asking about my details. I tend to make lot of grammatical errors while talking than while writing. 

I'm always super conscious of my English tho, be it written or spoken form, for the best or for the worst. 

Anyway, thanks for your advises mate, I really appreciate it.

Thanks for the insight, I will consider this one.

Thanks for your advice bro. Neenga yedhaachum local college ah ila well known college ah? Neengalum Anna uni dhaaane?

Thanks for your insights, brother. I will keep this in mind.

Very thanks for taking time to write me a comment. I really appreciate it. I do have a hard forgiving my parents for what they have done and doing to me tho whenever I think of doing something like that, I could feel my heart racing but, will keep your points in mind. 

Sorry to bother but, I would like to know your piece of advice for this one. 

So, what would be your final opinion. Should I focus on academics while simultaneously learning to code or any other skill? Or should I just solely stick with academics until I have cleared all arrears? What would be your opinion?

What about working as a content writer or copywriter? I'm ngl, although I'm not really much of an expert in coding, I'm willing to put effort but, since you have this suggestion for me, I just wanted to ask you, how's content writing and copywriting scene? Heard ChatGPT is doing all the work and many content, copywriters are jobless? More than coding, I genuinely love writing and using words with flow. That's why I'm asking for your insight.

>don't compare yourself with others mate, also don't get jealous looking at your friends, life is not fair, it will never

I know, it's just the feeling that if my parents were supportive of me, I could have gone to the same heights as my friends. 

It's not the feeling that you didn't get. 

It's the feeling that you could have had it, which haunts me. 

>threatening your parents going to work for one or two times, but not going to work all the time. Instead, it makes them prepare for the worst. so stop doing that shit.

Adhellam palaya kadha Anna... Just oru context kaaga sonna

Very very thanks for your kind words. I hope you are in a better place now where you get to make decisions for your own life.

>Have an idea of what you want in life. Build from there. You'll realise all this school, college, marks, none of it matters after a couple of years. It'll take time to get there, but you will.

Honestly, I'm kinda confused. I was into this societal IT job hype. I'm not that good with programming, I'm yet to learn coding properly and but would show interest if I had proper sources. I suck at logical thinking that is required in programming but, I genuinely love to sit down and correction run time errors. That's why I thought of going jump on this IT bandwagon. 

But here, people have commented that I'm good with my words and I should try for jobs such as project manager, UI/UX designing, tech writing, etc. 

Yes, ever since my school days, both my friends and my staffs have always told me that I'm good with my words and essay writing. 

Now, here's my doubt, should I go for high income promises like tech jobs in IT or follow what I do best like writing?

What the fuck ra? He is 19

Idk about that one chief. I always considered myself weak. I'm the kinda guy who would bulge even if someone slightly pinched me. Like chinnadha oru physical hurt na kuda thudichiruven 

I'm kinda sensitive to words of others. Either I would suck it all up or sob about it after locking my door.

>You are a very intelligent guy. Have faith in yourself that you will succeed in life. Unfortunately intelligent guys will become outcast during college years, because no one might understand you.

At this point, idk whether you folks say this kinda stuff to console me or are you guys being real?

Edit: Happy cake day btw

isnt free work bad?

>	heard that IT offices have mostly liberal circles. 

Sorry to break this bubble. But IT industry is the same as the real world outside. There are liberals, progressives, conservatives, extremists etc. 

liberal/progressive doesnt mean you dress well and go drinking and partying. It means you empathize with people who have problems that you don‚Äôt. You want to make their lives better. And you ll find those people. Don‚Äôt worry about it. Progressives tend to come together no matter where they are since their thought process align with each other. Maybe start volunteering at your local blue cross - it‚Äôs a great way to meet some amazing people who could potentially change your lives.

>	Apart from this project manager, content writer or copy writer, are there any other professions for writing and usage of words.

Technical writing is another job in the IT industry that needs someone to write good documentation. Business analysts jobs pay very well and needs people who are good with documentation. 

UI/UX designing jobs needs people who can understand the way people use things. 

Don‚Äôt limit yourself thinking software industry only has programming roles.

>	Really? My staffs and teachers have always told me that I look confused, as if my mind is preoccupied 

Haha‚Ä¶ thambi. It‚Äôs classic symptoms of someone who has a brilliant mind but is in the wrong place at the wrong time. But that‚Äôs ok. You still have 50-60 years to be at the place that makes sense to you. There is no rush man. Like I said - don‚Äôt be in a hurry to become an adult. Every single adult out there is cribbing about their life. So what‚Äôs the hurry to get to that phase. Medhuva vae pogalam. But pora journey a enjoy pannu. Easier said than done - and I‚Äôm not diminishing any of your feelings. They are legit feelings - but don‚Äôt let that define your entire experience of life. 

>	I was actually planning to do it after I graduate,

Why? Your hobbies, the time you spend on them, the pleasure you get out of them are all part of life. Why would you want to delay that and deny yourself? Velai ku poi sambadhikkuradhum life dhan, mottai Maadi la poi kaathadi vidradhum life dhan. One is not more important than the other. And hobbies are a great way of connecting with people who will understand you for who you are. Give it a try. 

>	Per sem ku 1 panradhuku badhila‚Ä¶ Time kedaikaradha poruththu yevlo arrears paper oru sem padika mudiyumo adha padichite poi yeludhaaamla

Yeah. 1 was just an arbitrary number I chose. But pick a number that wont over burden you.  Make sure you have a healthy mix of studying

Also seek therapy. Trust me it really really does help.

Nalla college lam illa bro en college topper college last bench karanum ore salery dhan ipo irukanga 3.5 lakhs mela placement varadu.

Unfortunately don‚Äôt have any idea bro. There is a writer‚Äôs strike going on in Hollywood currently and one of the things they want is the studios to stop using ChatGPT. But not sure what level of disruption that is causing in the industry itself.

But one thing you can try is to get in as a product owner and project management role. Less coding and more about breaking down and writing features.

> I know, it's just the feeling that if my parents were supportive of me, I could have gone to the same heights as my friends.

No, thats not true, whether someone support us or not, it is our own decisions and actions, we are responsible for our own decisions, try to learn how to own yourself.

Hmm, okay you might not like what I have to say. 

You're only finishing second year. You've got two years. By the time I was in my final year, I was like, fuck it. So for you, a lot of time to decide what you want. You might change your mind, your interests might change. I would say it's a good time to learn the skills you want.

Programming takes practice. Logical thinking too. I used to hear this a lot when I was in college too. You use logic in your life all the time. You did now when you wrote this instead of ending your life. So you are completely capable. If you enjoy coding, there are sources online where you can learn them. Experiment too. Find some mentors, seniors in college, ask them where you can find the best resource. Try breaking down the codes a little everyday. Understand how it all comes together. If you can test for errors, you'll find this easy. Try writing a few after a week or two. After a while, you won't need a complete breakdown since your brain is already primmed to figure it out faster. And you'll get better at it. Again, you need patience to do this.

If you want to try writing, same thing. You can practice writing professional scripts.

Most cases, it will be difficult to find time to do all this depending how flexible and lenient your college is. I would suggest a few mins is enough. You don't have to spend hours and hours losing sleep over this. 

This might sound like a bullshit advice. But this is what made me realise I didn't want to code for 8 hours a day, everyday. I enjoyed the critical thinking behind it, fascinated by the flows. But that was that. Imagining doing it for 5 days a week for years seemed like hell to me. Sucked the joy right out of it.

It will weed out what you DON'T want. And so the vision gets clearer. Don't try to pounce on everything fancy and flashy that comes along because you don't want to be left behind.

You don't have to absolutely love your job or field. But you need to be able to tolerate it. Look into options in areas you're interested in. Coding, pin point exactly what appeals to you. There are SO many options that will only confuse you by the time you finish college. Pick one role. Even if you can't land that job, you'll have the skillset to apply for something similar. 

Same goes with writing. You're good with words. It's smart to leverage what you're good with. But can you tolerate writing everyday? If so, what kind of writing you want to get into? Pick one in this too. Work on it everyday.

You can ask for advice from others. But ultimately, whatever you choose, you're the one to live the consequences.

No , You're not weak . 

Deep down you know yourself , it's just about a THIN LINE ~

Don't ever call yourself a weak , coz weak one doesn't dare so.

Gaining experience is valuable.

>UI/UX designing jobs needs people who can understand the way people use things.

Yeah just searched about it on Google. It says it requires visual communication, research, website frame, information architecture, writing, etc. 

>There are liberals, progressives, conservatives, extremists etc. liberal/progressive doesnt mean you dress well and go drinking and partying. It means you empathize with people who have problems that you don‚Äôt. You want to make their lives better.

Maybe I fell for the impression that if you speak English with your colleagues, wear expensive clothes, drink, smoke you, you are a liberal?  (Insert Gopi Sudhakar template, "subconscious classist ah naanu") 

Sorry to bother but, I would like to know your piece of advice for this one. 

So, what would be your final opinion. Should I focus on academics while simultaneously learning to master skills required for job opportunities? Or should I just solely stick with academics until I have cleared all arrears and then start learning skills? What would be your opinion?

>Haha‚Ä¶ thambi. It‚Äôs classic symptoms of someone who has a brilliant mind but is in the wrong place at the wrong time. But that‚Äôs ok. 

Aiyayo bro üòÖ Ippadi yellam sonneegana these things will only flare up my inner narcissism. Inga comments yellarume solraanga I'm being too harsh on myself

But, I always believed that I was somewhat of a narcissist. Yen manasula orama, "Namba dhaa periya aalu mathavangaluku onnum theriyaadhu" nu gira maadhri dhaa Naa yosipen

I have been working on it too. Lately I have been coming to terms that everybody is special and has something to offer, no matter how dumb or poor they might be in a particular domain. 

Maybe the self assessment about myself is wrong? Anyhow 

>Why? Your hobbies, the time you spend on them, the pleasure you get out of them are all part of life. Why would you want to delay that and deny yourself?

Okay this might sound weird but, I kinda made it as my end goal to clear as many arrears as possible within a short span of time while simultaneously not letting any new arrear pile up and developing skills required for industries.

>My friends who all went on to big things after failing in college - did through their connections. 

Yeah, I used to have an insta meme page of 1k followers. There, I used to connect with my followers, a few of them happened to be IT employees, engineering graduates and MNC employees themselves.

Thanks for taking time to give out your opinion.

Thanks for believing in me even when I'm not. I mean, you don't even know but you have these humongous levels of belief in me. Thanks :)

Sorry to bother but, I would like to know your piece of advice for this one. 

So, what would be your final opinion. Should I focus on academics while simultaneously learning to code or any other skill? Or should I just solely stick with academics until I have cleared all arrears? What would be your opinion?

I would say focus on getting your degree and build some healthy hobbies. I strongly believe that a well rounded person needs to have 1-2 hobbies and a few close friends. For now just focus on these things and forget about what you will get out of it in the future. Dhoni solra madhiri the process is what matters, the results don‚Äôt.

Skill building can happen in the last year of college cos you will have fewer papers to study for. You can even take a year after college to focus on specific skills that are in demand in the job market. You can take up a start up job and learn the basics of the industry and how to work in a corporate world. Every experience counts and enhances you as a person. So don‚Äôt discount any experience

>Idhellam pannumbodhu, yedhuku hobbies, adhellam waste of time dhaane

Any moment you are alive isn‚Äôt a waste. Because you are living your life - and like I said that is the purpose of life. To live. Who is to say that having a job and working to make someone else rich the right way of living life? Every moment you make yourself happy is the best moment of your life. Hobbies are an important part of a healthy life style. They are the only things in life that will give you poor joy. No job or salary or grade will give you the kind of satisfaction a hobby will. And don‚Äôt let anyone tell you what‚Äôs a good hobby and what‚Äôs not a good hobby. Any hobby that gives you intrinsic joy is a good hobby.

Ada thambi, had 17 arrears once. Living a good life once. Touched the book evening before exam and cleared too.

Narcissism venum bro. It's not a bad thing. Most of us study for 2 days and clear exams. It's something to be proud of. If arrears bothers you just put a study plan and knock that shit off bro.

Feel free to pm. Like everyone said you are a semma clarity ulla payyan. You will do great in life. College sucks for everyone ma.

Likely they are all outsourced to some agency bro. Unless it‚Äôs huge marketing firm, they won‚Äôt have in house ppl doing work.

Idk about MBA as I have seen some engineers make the switch. Maybe there is a course you can do. PMP certification for project management requires years of experience unfortunately. But you don‚Äôt need that to get a junior position.

Mmh , welcome

Focus on present academics with arrears when you're confident enough , start learning one skill which seems more important.

Pannalam. You can explain how collobarated with others, how you took initiative, how you showcased results in your Java programmer role. Those are intrinsic qualities that will translate to any corporate job.

Should be possible. But forget about that for now. Just focus on the present - like I said, now is your time to become a well rounded person with good connections and good hobbies and a degree to back you up in terms of education. It is more important to stay happy in the present than worrying too much about the future. Don‚Äôt compromise on your current happiness for a future hypothetical state of financial prosperity. 

The results will follow your process. So stay grounded in the present and work on your current happiness. You will be surprised how much you can accomplish with a A healthy mind in a happy state

First option bro. Skills are important in workplace. No one will care about degree once you join workplace. It‚Äôs just a requirement to get in. So focus on academics but also do coding. Doesn‚Äôt have to be paid training. Go to leet code and do problems there.

Okay very thanks for replying to all my queries ü´Ç

Okay bro

Okay bro, thanks for your piece of advice.

>Go to leet code and do problems there.

Planning to take up any course on udemy? Most probably I will go for Java since I have been told that it has high demand in IT industry?

Yeah. Java is def popular. Leet code will let you learn about algos bro. Do check it out, it‚Äôs very popular for coding questions.

Sorry if I sound ignorant but, I thought leetcode was this website from where you could practice your coding? As in, let's say you wanted to practice your coding, you could find a problem specifically asking to write a program that would find whether a number is odd or even, find prime number... To build towers of hanoi... That kinda problems based website

Didn't know you could actually get coaching classes from that website

Depression is being overused and romanticised in social media. Clinical depression is something which is diagnosed by a psychiatrist . If you feel someone is not doing good , first ask them whether are they ok and need any help.
Who tf asks that straight away? Prechana irrundha depression irrkum ah? To be there for someone battling depression ngra Peru la people are forgetting eppo yenna pesuradhu nu. I appreciate your concern towards him, but this is not the correct way to ask someone. Also the way he switched from Machan to bro, I guess he is just annoyed/fed up with the prechana he is going through. PS: You might know more about him that led you to think he might be depressed. I said things from what I could get to know about him from this conversation.
People need an ear, to rant or to vent out. I would say there is nothing wrong in asking but be respectful. Also, charge podu ney :)
I hv worked with few psychiatric pts... Oru call panni palaya kathai pesunga bro knjm neram. Then probe this topic... Prachanai solved ah nu. Give him a place to vent. If he is comfortable enough to share with you , he would. Illana force pannatheenga... Let him knw u r there and ask him to reach out if he needs anything. Also plan something like meet up with a small gang. These are all you could do to help him as a friend.
Meet in person.
I would suggest to talk to him in person. Sometimes people don't tell even when they are depressed even to their close friends. Try to tell him your personal worry or worries to get him to open up. That worked on me by my psychiatrist. I didn't open up and he told me how his father didn't treat him as a doctor as he took up psychiatry rather than brain surgery like his father. I took network engineering rather than be a programmer and my father didn't support me at all. So, be patient, don't straight away ask him about his mental health. Message him daily about 'nothings' till you feel you can ask him about this. Again, it is better to do in person. I am really proud of you to care about your friend. You are an awesome friend üëç
It could be some temporary stressful situation too, but nevertheless you tried to care which is good! Also I feel people that are genuinely struggling with depression may not really talk About it at the first instance itself or insinuate that very directly(I may be generalizing but this is what I have noted personally) infact, you might not even know they are depressed until you notice a pattern of veiled instances. Anyway, good that you want to be a friend in need and so hope you are able to do something good for your friend!

Thank you so much buddy for the compliments. I actually wanted to ask because in case anything happens no point in being reactive so I tried to be proactive and just had those thoughts about him. Normally, he is not that guy who will fed up as I have known him for a long time. I am the one who actually get mood swings compared to him. Well how about your state right now buddy. I hope you are doing well. Well he is actually stuck with work and accounting lectures so I don't know when we can meet together but hopefully your suggestions will work out.
Going and meeting is the perfect suggestion. However, I'll tell you this much that handling a person not in a good mental state is difficult. It's not as simple as going and meeting them and talking to them a few times. It helps definitely, but might not reverse the situation completely. I'll suggest taking him to a counselor or psychologist as well when possible. Don't forget that it's a big commitment, and it could be exhausting / overwhelming
Normal ah irunu artham bro.
safe
Ah man I should not have asked that straight away. I was dumb af as I was in workplace and to be honest I was wondering why he didn't wish me on my birthday (I knew something was definitely wrong in his life). Because he was born the day before me so he obviously knows my birthday. I wished him as usual but he replied late and that gave me a hint that something was not right with him. He even told me that he quit insurance because it was stressful and he joined a company as accounts assistant. He says all days are packed and I never seen him that panicked and depressed like that in my life. He is a positive guy. Yeah adulthood can sucks at times and I think it got into him
Mental health deterioration is a serious concern. Of late one of our college mate (same batch mate but different stream) ended his life. He was very introvert. Despite we having multiple whatsapp group no one was aware what is going on with him.

Wow never heard this before. But it does sound nice indeed.
Correct bro, That's because most people don't want to listen to you. They just want to give a solution to your problem or basically feel like they've solved your problem. It's not like they are judging us all the time. Sometimes people are impatient or inconsiderate
[deleted]
Ah niceeee

Think your name gives out why you are feeling this way. I think you are trying nofap. That is really good. PMO reduces your dopomine levels which is crtitcal for positivity and happiness

In real life people don't show the sadness...and many chaps you see on internet might be unemployed,sad because of breakup or worrying about parents that's why

TIL I'm a dick

People think normal "sadness" and clinical "depression" are the same.

Sila nerangalil sila manidhargal. It is not worth worrying about others. Be assertive than aggressive. Be tactful than pretend to be tough, acknowledge all your emotions. Just live your life to its fullest. No external validation. You living your life okthe way you deem fit. I was depressed not because I wanted to be accepted, i am pretty fine being alone. I lost my mum to cancer, the process of not knowing cope kicked me off the corner. It took a long long time to talk about my mom without without crying. That‚Äôs is when I knew I have healed.

Depression is really a strong word. But people say i have depression to look cool online and to gain attention. They are just actually sad that's it. Both are completely different

Feeling depressed is normal human emotion. Depression is the prolonged feeling of depression, these Cases of depression are usually minor, seeing a therapist would help- usually there would be a reason why the person is depressed I.e a breakup, financial issues. Clinical depression such as major depressive disorder is a more serve form of depression where therapy won‚Äôt help. And medical intervention is required such as anti depressant - in these cases the person don‚Äôt even know why they are feeling depressed to an extend it affects their daily life. Source: I have MAD, mania, MDD. I have to take pills just to feel human

Lifestyle changes. Our food, screentime and social circles have all changed for the worse. We don't get enough sleep, healthy food or even clean air. My grandmother told me when she was small they would sleep with sunset and wake up only when the rooster crowed the next day. Now I'm up all night because I'm unable to sleep.

Depression is loss of meaning. Its when you do not want to engage in things which you thought were desirable. All of your actions seems meaningless. Your family, friends, sports, hobbies, interests, they all stop working as a means to entertain you. and any hope for a propose vanishes. This state of mind then causes sadness. I think one of the primary reason for depression is lack of faith. The modern youth do not want to accept anything which is not provable through the scientific method. Most abhor religion. Some abhor philosophy too. God is simply a made up story and doesn't matter In there decision making. what is useful is more important than what is true. There lack of interest in finding out the truth has narrowed their view on life. Hence causing them to think it's all meaningless!

I forget who said it but in the postmodern postindustrial world we live in it‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs something wrong with you if you‚Äôre not depressed and/or have anxiety. Humans were not built to live like this. That‚Äôs why they say The Matrix is a documentary (read Brave New World). Alternatively it‚Äôs like Idiocracy or something where everyone‚Äôs too stupid to be depressed lmao

The world has become so far away for all of us to connect. There is video by Kurzgesagt. They explain that even though we live in the age of easy access to people, we are not exactly connected. I don't think I'll ever be able to show my true emotions out in the world because of the fear of how I might be judged. I keep the emotional side of me to myself. This is very unhealthy but I am scared sometime. When I talk to people, I simply wear a mask of joy or happiness if i am in a unavoidable circumstance. This is becoming the norm these days. People are afraid to speak up. People are afraid to show their vulnerable emotional side. I hope I am able to overcome this and everybody else too. So, you are not the only one who feels this way.

The truth is that we now know the name for what we are experiencing. Doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt exist before that. We can see and point our feeling. This is a good sign.

Depression is common and since we‚Äôve progressed as a society , more people feel comfortable admitting that they are struggling. I saddened by the comments here that think they can dictate to other people what real depression means or is. Like who are we to decide when someone‚Äôs emotions are bad enough for us to give them the depression card?

Depression has now become an identity for most of the people. I used to believe that all my failures in my life was because of depression. I used to tell this to people as an excuse for not being responsible enough. When I started taking care of myself, this depression nonsense was not a differentiator in my existence. And many people like myself don't have an idea on depression. For eg, If I had a fight with my mom, I'll be sad for a day but I used to think that was depression. Depression is the new Sadness..

As a person who was actual heavily depressed and came out of it, i can confidently say the person you least expect is the most depressed. In my experience, depression is not the sudden feeling of sadness. It becomes the way you live you life. You become distant, you don‚Äôt care about anything. Even yourself. Nothing tends to matter but you still move through the motions of life. You become a walking husk of yourself and you don‚Äôt even realise it for a long time. People confuse sadness with depression. Finding out what is what is the first step.

My Take 1 Increase in drugs usage. 2 Usage of social media like ig, fb and LinkedIn makes us constantly question and worry 3 Caste and religion shitting on most peoples love life.

Most people pretend to be depressed in order to get attraction / correct girls ( like remo walking in traffic scene in anniyan) But sad thing is, this tactics works. In short they are cunning

The reason, the term depression is not properly defined in todays reality. A person , who had break-up , or lost job or lost someone becomes sad and worries a lot about the things he lost. Which makes him to be sad all the time and this is termed as depression , but actually it‚Äôs a temporary emotional downtime which would get better if they focus on the goals and shift their thinking away from it . This is what we see more now a days and that‚Äôs why the numbers are more. But there are some people who are literally stuck in a problem or situation where they feel like they can‚Äôt do anything and continues to be in the same state for a very long time and that‚Äôs when things start to go south. This is when we need assistance to come out of it. Coming to your point: surrounded by people who you feel are cunning can make you feel agitated, cause you know that they are There for their benefits and the thing you know about this but you can‚Äôt do anything and you play cool when they are around . This is common now and just try to stay away from them. Having a daily routine will always help you to focus on next thing , so you don‚Äôt have to overthink everything.

I was depressed for the most part cuz, I felt empty, beleive it or not, having something to be depressed about is much better than having nothing to be depressed about.

I think this is a phenomenon prevalent and rising all over the world. Changing times are giving rise to changing cultures (economic and social) and the pressures to adapt to them. It is a mixture of latent depression coming to light (through social media) and the newer developments of it due to these pressures which also can be attributed to the value comparisons that ensue of one's own life to others in terms of fulfillment. The addictive characteristic intrinsic in the design of social media leads to escapism and further reinforces the value comparison, both of which don't help us work on our behavioral issues. It is not to say that these issues didn't exist before social media, but as mentioned earlier, it is coming to light and is even being exacerbated through it. These factors are some of which are leading to a rise in declining mental health. Some healthier alternatives for helping improve our mental health: 1. Stop following the pages that lower our self-worth. Limited and self-monitored social media usage and phone usage in general will help stabilize dopamine levels. 2. Quit Porn. Masturbation is healthy when it's managed properly, stick to your imagination and keep it to at most once every two weeks (personal opinion). 3. Actively working on our mental health through talk-therapy with a mental health professional, medication (if necessary, prescribed by a professional), meditation, self-reflection to truly address and work on recurring thought/behavior patterns that are detrimental to our psychological well-being (again this can be approached more effectively by openly speaking with a mental health professional who practices cognitive behavioral therapy). 4. Actively participating in creating and fostering healthy and supportive friendships, relationships, and communities, while cutting and staying away from relationships that contribute to further deterioration of our mental health. 5. Learning life-skills like cooking, doing laundry, and cleaning. Not only are they practical in use, but they also help with confidence in ourselves to be independent. 6. Getting into hobbies we truly want to explore. 7. Getting some good and regular exercise (even just walking outside for a while helps a lot, without using our phones). 8. Maintaining good hygiene, grooming ourselves (for our own satisfaction rather than for external validation). 9. Reading (fiction and non-fiction, reading self-help books is fine, but they become redundant and personally I think it's more effective for the brain to read fiction/non-fiction as they engage the creative parts of the brain). Most important of all: 10. Being kind to ourselves, self-parenting is essential in present times and a privilege our past was not educated about. There is no benefit in giving ourselves a hard time by comparing our unique journey with others. There is no need to pressure ourselves to do all these things very quickly. To take it all a step at a time (but religiously commit to it) is to live a full life. If you're here after reading through all that, thank you and I'm sorry for the wall of text, but I hope it helps, have a good one. We're all journeying together and no one is alone.

Life is not all sunshine and rainbows. You need to stop imagining one such life and face what is put in front of you. Depression is a conflict between what life should be and what life is.

Dude, chill, this is reddit where people wants to express their darker half feelings, rant, reduce burden by pouring out. And the same people use the other social media to show how chill I am. Reddit and other social media are not the same because of their identity is anonymous. Feel to share your inner feelings.

It‚Äôs better understood and openly talked about. I don‚Äôt think it is ‚Äúbecoming common‚Äù

Saying u r in depression has become a fashion statement nowadays. They don't even know what clinical depression means

I feel triggered whenever I read the news or someone sends me something related to caste because suddenly that's all I see. I said this to a friend and she called me a Savarna but I'm not a Savarna. I don't even know what that means. I've grown up in an urban environment without knowing what my caste was, and now I've grown up and found out, done research, turns out my ancestors were all what we would call Dalit who got pushed over to a different category. I feel helpless when someone blames me or my ancestors for existing, or even talks bad of my gods, I can't do anything can I. This adds to my anxiety. A friend in AP sent me reading on Periyar last night when I was about to sleep, I couldn't sleep after I just checked the name of the book, because, overthinking. It's extremely sad. I know my family did all they can to help everyone they could, like I try to do. It's such a complex situation.

People out there throwing out the terms 'Depression' 'Anxiety' like confetti to such a level that it has become extremely clich√©.

Some people get depressed with low likes for their SM posts.

You can avoid sadness turning into something else. Get busy, learn something new, learn a language,trek (if you don't have money to travel), etc.

What we eat + childhood experiences / development. These play a good chunk on how we feel to be honest. Starts from the beginning.

I told myself I don't have depression when I first visited a psychiatrist (my parents tricked me into meeting one) and he went on to give some medicines (antidepressants and sleeping pills) and I was fine, till I decided not to take them. Then we stopped going at one point but I couldn't quite say whether I was depressed, or sad or just lonely. A noticeable change was when I started having suicidal thoughts, something which I've had at times as a child but became frequent by the time I was done with college. Adding fuel to the fire was the death of my friend, which on one hand made me aware that I was very much susceptible to killing myself, but later on I kinda realised that my friend shouldn't have done that. His cause of death to me was due to his 18 arrears he had, whereas a year after he died, I was in the process of clearing my 22 arrears via Online exams, which I passed

Ge off your phone.. and get used to not having any form ofninstant gratification.. once that happens, you'll see through all this crap around you..

we study what are told to most of the times we never do the job we are tempted or passionate of we follow some social structure that never existed we all wanna play it safe some people call to take risk at office space that is not your risk at all but to tame yourself to obey them end of the day post 40's we live a life with EMI and health insurance. it all started at our early age where we failed to communicate well bcz our parents are not aware of things and insecure,. very very few children or 20's grown human break this loop very few make friends that are worthy enough to reach passion rather making comparative LPA to office friends or dumb relatives.

I feel depression is a very word. People being in the state of sadness say themselves that they are depressed. Being sad is okay but feeling sad deliberately is a wrong state of mind. I firmly believe that people can come out of this dark phase of their life. If you‚Äôre genuinely depressed then please seek mental counselling.

I got really good at hiding how i really feel in real life because i don‚Äôt want to lose out on opportunities and friendships due to my mental issues. Social Media is a place where i can mostly be myself so i don‚Äôt have to pretend. I‚Äôm sure this is the case for many other people as well.

Comparison is the destruction of joy, in other words depression. Find your geek and embrace it, that will become joy of your life by lending a hand to those in need. Have a great day.

It was always there, people have started to get more aware about it now.

I guess one cause could be that, we are away from nature so much.. If you take a walk in the park filled with greenery, just 20 minutes of it,. I guess it will help.. For me, it has worked.. just a walk in park.. Sometimes even doing few exercises or trying some yogasanas has helped me.. in the sense that i feel something different in a positive way.. The time i spend with phone, checking LinkedIn filled with accomplishments from others, checking WhatsApp statuses about others, checking YouTube videos mindlessly all above factors bring me down...

Depression is not something which majority of the people think how it will be. You will never know what people going through unless otherwise they share it completely. And in most case, if they come to the level of sharing, they ‚Äú

Sogama irukradhellam clinical depression illa da parama. People should understand this.

Bro world has become more competitive.. people trying to live up to certain standards by comparing themselves with other people and get depressed thinking they're not good career/life/family wise. And IMO people who have depression without any reason(breakup/family/career) is the most dangerous depression. That's the clinical depression that occurs just internally by body changes/hormones etc. No extrenal reasons whatsoever. They just feel empty and fight a lot of internal demons. People should reach out to a Therapist if they have something like that. Kudos to everyone that has fought depression and coming out the other end!! My heart goes out to everyone undergoing this Battle

Comparison is the thief of all joy. We live in a world where we are constantly comparing ourselves to others because of social media, news, media etc. Everyone has insecurities on the inside but we feel the urge to showcase our 'best' life in public Try and focus on yourself and what you need to do, it's much more healthy for your mind.

Yeah PMO induced the idea of depression in my mind. I was a person who was unaware of what it feels to be depressed few years before. Even now I don't know whether I'm truly depressed, i just feel bad for all those wrong decisions which I took lead me to toda who I'm and working to reverse it.

What is PMO? Google says Project Management Office. I don't think you meant that. Elaborate please.

Not necessarily, I'm in constant depression without any major scenarios like the one you mentioned. With late night overthinking and disoriented sleep, bad dreams, etc

You don‚Äôt have to be any of those things to be depressed. You can have everything in the fucking world and still be depressed, perhaps more so - you see depression higher in developed countries.

could you pls stop generalizing? I have my own best freind..she has 15LPA just hit her 30's., no debts.. she is deppressed like anything., eventho got an busy schedule and physically healthy life with partner. this is some un explainable scenario which could not be sterotyped.

( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Hi , I‚Äôm Rick!

This ! ... It's okay to be sad, eventually you will get over it ... As long as you don't drown your sorrows with liqour and drugs, then that would turn into an endless vicious cycle .... But clinical depression is not a phase and unfortunately people confuse the two

I'm sorry for your loss. It's good you have overcome it . Life is unfair sometimes, but it is what it is. I don't know philosophy... So this what I could say. You are a strong person.

This needed to be said.

I just want you to know that you are going to be fine. It's not a lot but I am proud of you.

Feeling depressed is not normal.. i think you are confusing it with sadness.. On the other hand if someone considers high fever as normal human thing then your logic would be applicable.

I have MDD also.. and i couldn't agree more with you

Don't fall for that trash talk by the oldies.. these things did exist in their days too.. they didn't know what it was coz of lack of information or they just dismissed it

This is so much truth for me to know.

Hehe cool

Right

There is a demon at every level More you level up, you should slide/dodge than fight

This leads to me giving off a sad ish vibe on most days.

Me. Whenever I make a reel and it doesn't get the traction my older reels got I hate myself

Bro it's worth your lifetime living for and by the side of your parents. It's a blessing. Don't ever let yourself down and especially your mom down in any situation. I believe in God. And it's them. Our parents are our Gods. Not only for creating us, their sacrifice and efforts for us to live a better life is immeasurable , priceless .

You are absolutely right.

:-/ factu factu factu

Correct light ? Enlighten me please

>The time i spend with phone, checking LinkedIn filled with accomplishments from others, checking WhatsApp statuses about others, checking YouTube videos mindlessly This has helped you, seriously ?

Bruh, i'm just 22 and i'm all healthy and in ideal BMI. And i'm not an idiot to not know i have diabetes, it's the lack of motivation and repeated failures lead me here. I'm getting over this for real.

Feel you bro . .. been there ..once you accept that you have a problem . You will work it out .. will take sometime .. but you will get there

Porn Masturbation & Orgasm

yeah also they might have other problems...

In past good food, shelter, having a small family and a niche was heaven. These days, they are nothing.

I just said about the common problems..did I deny there aren't other problems edit:typo

Congratulations.

Thank you! Don‚Äôt worry naamalam tsunamileh swimadipom, seeking treatment feeling great üòá

No no. She helped me through my depression. Made sure I took medicines, took me to therapy. She just told me this when I asked why are we getting all this when they didn't go through it. My family has been super supportive, and have regular meetings with my therapist for progress too.

I mean how we don't grow or eat healthy anymore. If I was back home, I'd eat from plants in our balcony garden, or from a neighborhood mill, get cow milk from an aunty who lives down the road and so on. I'm on my phone, anxious and unable to sleep at night, I try keeping my phone away and I'm anxious about being unable at work or a commitment. This is a lifestyle change.

Smartphones well, yes ofcourse

Agreed! Learning this.

[deleted]

Yeah, I'm not a transformed person, but occasionally when I walked in the park or occasionally when I did little bit of exercise, something different i felt. Not that I push myself to park or exercise..

In that case i must say... Dude count your lucky stars daily.. not everyone has such a supportive family especially in such matters

True that about eating healthy.. and yes putting away the phone sometimes does just lead to feeling even more worse

Buddy even I'm doing CA lol

Yeah! I'm aware. My relatives have been nice. This started with the first time I got pimples and freaked out, my family was like we got them, they will fall off. Same with mental health, they've seen relatives go through horrible spaces without therapy or medicines, that's why they're more open to change. Also, on TV and news so many stories of kids committing suicide and so on. It scares them because they love my sister and me so much.

Yeahh! Exactly. We don't have the social circles they have too. Their best friends were their cousins, I don't even live in the same place as my cousins (who are all small so won't understand what I'm saying).

Agreed
