15g641x,Had a chat with a close friend of mine today whom I know since my school days. Should I be worried about this the way he responded. He seems depressed or am I overthinking?,"Guys I straight away jumped into whether he has depression could be a turn off but when he told ""inga veroru prachanaila irunthen athala wish pana mudila"" nu sollakula I actually thought something was not right. He is a very good friend who is nice to everyone and have been friends since school days. Now we are working into our 20s. What should I do about this? Should I just leave as it is or should I inquire on him whats the issue. If he has personal issues, then I definitely cannot cross the boundary line. I am in a dilemma but he seems to be hiding something from me.",Chennai,Kathanayagan-3821,1690974840,89,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/15g641x/had_a_chat_with_a_close_friend_of_mine_today_whom/
