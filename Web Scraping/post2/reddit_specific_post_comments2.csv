To be there for someone battling depression ngra Peru la people are forgetting eppo yenna pesuradhu nu. 

I appreciate your concern towards him, but this is not the correct way to ask someone.

Also the way he switched from Machan to bro, I guess he is just annoyed/fed up with the prechana he is going through.


PS: You might know more about him that led you to think he might be depressed. I said things from what I could get to know about him from this conversation.",1690978060,27

15g641x,juh08hn,sas8184,"I would suggest to talk to him in person. Sometimes people don't tell even when they are depressed even to their close friends. Try to tell him your personal worry or worries to get him to open up. That worked on me by my psychiatrist. I didn't open up and he told me how his father didn't treat him as a doctor as he took up psychiatry rather than brain surgery like his father. I took network engineering rather than be a programmer and my father didn't support me at all.

 So, be patient, don't straight away ask him about his mental health. Message him daily about 'nothings' till you feel you can ask him about this. Again, it is better to do in person. 

I am really proud of you to care about your friend. You are an awesome friend üëç",1690978161,4
15g641x,juh4i2r,date_micheal,"It could be some temporary stressful situation too, but nevertheless you tried to care which is good! 

Also I feel people that are genuinely struggling with depression may not really talk About it at the first instance itself or insinuate that very directly(I may be generalizing but this is what I have noted personally) infact, you might not even know they are depressed until you notice a pattern of veiled instances. 

Anyway, good that you want to be a friend in need and so hope you are able to do something good for your friend!",1690980339,2

I actually wanted to ask because in case anything happens no point in being reactive so I tried to be proactive and just had those thoughts about him. Normally, he is not that guy who will fed up as I have known him for a long time. I am the one who actually get mood swings compared to him. 

Well how about your state right now buddy. I hope you are doing well. Well he is actually stuck with work and accounting lectures so I don't know when we can meet together but hopefully your suggestions will work out.",1690988315,2
15g641x,jukdqxo,dubuk_dubuk,"Going and meeting is the perfect suggestion. However, I'll tell you this much that handling a person not in a good mental state is difficult. It's not as simple as going and meeting them and talking to them a few times. It helps definitely, but might not reverse the situation completely. 
I'll suggest taking him to a counselor or psychologist as well when possible.

15g641x,juhoqc0,Kathanayagan-3821,Ah man I should not have asked that straight away. I was dumb af as I was in workplace and to be honest I was wondering why he didn't wish me on my birthday (I knew something was definitely wrong in his life). Because he was born the day before me so he obviously knows my birthday. I wished him as usual but he replied late and that gave me a hint that something was not right with him. He even told me that he quit insurance because it was stressful and he joined a company as accounts assistant. He says all days are packed and I never seen him that panicked and depressed like that in my life. He is a positive guy. Yeah adulthood can sucks at times and I think it got into him,1690988852,3
