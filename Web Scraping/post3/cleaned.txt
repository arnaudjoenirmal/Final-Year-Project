Think your name gives out why you are feeling this way. I think you are trying nofap. That is really good. PMO reduces your dopomine levels which is crtitcal for positivity and happiness

In real life people don't show the sadness...and many chaps you see on internet might be unemployed,sad because of breakup or worrying about parents that's why

TIL I'm a dick

People think normal "sadness" and clinical "depression" are the same.

Sila nerangalil sila manidhargal. It is not worth worrying about others. Be assertive than aggressive. Be tactful than pretend to be tough, acknowledge all your emotions. Just live your life to its fullest. No external validation. You living your life okthe way you deem fit. I was depressed not because I wanted to be accepted, i am pretty fine being alone. I lost my mum to cancer, the process of not knowing cope kicked me off the corner. It took a long long time to talk about my mom without without crying. That’s is when I knew I have healed.

Depression is really a strong word. But people say i have depression to look cool online and to gain attention. They are just actually sad that's it. Both are completely different

Feeling depressed is normal human emotion. Depression is the prolonged feeling of depression, these Cases of depression are usually minor, seeing a therapist would help- usually there would be a reason why the person is depressed I.e a breakup, financial issues. Clinical depression such as major depressive disorder is a more serve form of depression where therapy won’t help. And medical intervention is required such as anti depressant - in these cases the person don’t even know why they are feeling depressed to an extend it affects their daily life. Source: I have MAD, mania, MDD. I have to take pills just to feel human

Lifestyle changes. Our food, screentime and social circles have all changed for the worse. We don't get enough sleep, healthy food or even clean air. My grandmother told me when she was small they would sleep with sunset and wake up only when the rooster crowed the next day. Now I'm up all night because I'm unable to sleep.

Depression is loss of meaning. Its when you do not want to engage in things which you thought were desirable. All of your actions seems meaningless. Your family, friends, sports, hobbies, interests, they all stop working as a means to entertain you. and any hope for a propose vanishes. This state of mind then causes sadness. I think one of the primary reason for depression is lack of faith. The modern youth do not want to accept anything which is not provable through the scientific method. Most abhor religion. Some abhor philosophy too. God is simply a made up story and doesn't matter In there decision making. what is useful is more important than what is true. There lack of interest in finding out the truth has narrowed their view on life. Hence causing them to think it's all meaningless!

I forget who said it but in the postmodern postindustrial world we live in it’s almost like there’s something wrong with you if you’re not depressed and/or have anxiety. Humans were not built to live like this. That’s why they say The Matrix is a documentary (read Brave New World). Alternatively it’s like Idiocracy or something where everyone’s too stupid to be depressed lmao

The world has become so far away for all of us to connect. There is video by Kurzgesagt. They explain that even though we live in the age of easy access to people, we are not exactly connected. I don't think I'll ever be able to show my true emotions out in the world because of the fear of how I might be judged. I keep the emotional side of me to myself. This is very unhealthy but I am scared sometime. When I talk to people, I simply wear a mask of joy or happiness if i am in a unavoidable circumstance. This is becoming the norm these days. People are afraid to speak up. People are afraid to show their vulnerable emotional side. I hope I am able to overcome this and everybody else too. So, you are not the only one who feels this way.

The truth is that we now know the name for what we are experiencing. Doesn’t mean it didn’t exist before that. We can see and point our feeling. This is a good sign.

Depression is common and since we’ve progressed as a society , more people feel comfortable admitting that they are struggling. I saddened by the comments here that think they can dictate to other people what real depression means or is. Like who are we to decide when someone’s emotions are bad enough for us to give them the depression card?

Depression has now become an identity for most of the people. I used to believe that all my failures in my life was because of depression. I used to tell this to people as an excuse for not being responsible enough. When I started taking care of myself, this depression nonsense was not a differentiator in my existence. And many people like myself don't have an idea on depression. For eg, If I had a fight with my mom, I'll be sad for a day but I used to think that was depression. Depression is the new Sadness..

As a person who was actual heavily depressed and came out of it, i can confidently say the person you least expect is the most depressed. In my experience, depression is not the sudden feeling of sadness. It becomes the way you live you life. You become distant, you don’t care about anything. Even yourself. Nothing tends to matter but you still move through the motions of life. You become a walking husk of yourself and you don’t even realise it for a long time. People confuse sadness with depression. Finding out what is what is the first step.

My Take 1 Increase in drugs usage. 2 Usage of social media like ig, fb and LinkedIn makes us constantly question and worry 3 Caste and religion shitting on most peoples love life.

Most people pretend to be depressed in order to get attraction / correct girls ( like remo walking in traffic scene in anniyan) But sad thing is, this tactics works. In short they are cunning

The reason, the term depression is not properly defined in todays reality. A person , who had break-up , or lost job or lost someone becomes sad and worries a lot about the things he lost. Which makes him to be sad all the time and this is termed as depression , but actually it’s a temporary emotional downtime which would get better if they focus on the goals and shift their thinking away from it . This is what we see more now a days and that’s why the numbers are more. But there are some people who are literally stuck in a problem or situation where they feel like they can’t do anything and continues to be in the same state for a very long time and that’s when things start to go south. This is when we need assistance to come out of it. Coming to your point: surrounded by people who you feel are cunning can make you feel agitated, cause you know that they are There for their benefits and the thing you know about this but you can’t do anything and you play cool when they are around . This is common now and just try to stay away from them. Having a daily routine will always help you to focus on next thing , so you don’t have to overthink everything.

I was depressed for the most part cuz, I felt empty, beleive it or not, having something to be depressed about is much better than having nothing to be depressed about.

I think this is a phenomenon prevalent and rising all over the world. Changing times are giving rise to changing cultures (economic and social) and the pressures to adapt to them. It is a mixture of latent depression coming to light (through social media) and the newer developments of it due to these pressures which also can be attributed to the value comparisons that ensue of one's own life to others in terms of fulfillment. The addictive characteristic intrinsic in the design of social media leads to escapism and further reinforces the value comparison, both of which don't help us work on our behavioral issues. It is not to say that these issues didn't exist before social media, but as mentioned earlier, it is coming to light and is even being exacerbated through it. These factors are some of which are leading to a rise in declining mental health. Some healthier alternatives for helping improve our mental health: 1. Stop following the pages that lower our self-worth. Limited and self-monitored social media usage and phone usage in general will help stabilize dopamine levels. 2. Quit Porn. Masturbation is healthy when it's managed properly, stick to your imagination and keep it to at most once every two weeks (personal opinion). 3. Actively working on our mental health through talk-therapy with a mental health professional, medication (if necessary, prescribed by a professional), meditation, self-reflection to truly address and work on recurring thought/behavior patterns that are detrimental to our psychological well-being (again this can be approached more effectively by openly speaking with a mental health professional who practices cognitive behavioral therapy). 4. Actively participating in creating and fostering healthy and supportive friendships, relationships, and communities, while cutting and staying away from relationships that contribute to further deterioration of our mental health. 5. Learning life-skills like cooking, doing laundry, and cleaning. Not only are they practical in use, but they also help with confidence in ourselves to be independent. 6. Getting into hobbies we truly want to explore. 7. Getting some good and regular exercise (even just walking outside for a while helps a lot, without using our phones). 8. Maintaining good hygiene, grooming ourselves (for our own satisfaction rather than for external validation). 9. Reading (fiction and non-fiction, reading self-help books is fine, but they become redundant and personally I think it's more effective for the brain to read fiction/non-fiction as they engage the creative parts of the brain). Most important of all: 10. Being kind to ourselves, self-parenting is essential in present times and a privilege our past was not educated about. There is no benefit in giving ourselves a hard time by comparing our unique journey with others. There is no need to pressure ourselves to do all these things very quickly. To take it all a step at a time (but religiously commit to it) is to live a full life. If you're here after reading through all that, thank you and I'm sorry for the wall of text, but I hope it helps, have a good one. We're all journeying together and no one is alone.

Life is not all sunshine and rainbows. You need to stop imagining one such life and face what is put in front of you. Depression is a conflict between what life should be and what life is.

Dude, chill, this is reddit where people wants to express their darker half feelings, rant, reduce burden by pouring out. And the same people use the other social media to show how chill I am. Reddit and other social media are not the same because of their identity is anonymous. Feel to share your inner feelings.

It’s better understood and openly talked about. I don’t think it is “becoming common”

Saying u r in depression has become a fashion statement nowadays. They don't even know what clinical depression means

I feel triggered whenever I read the news or someone sends me something related to caste because suddenly that's all I see. I said this to a friend and she called me a Savarna but I'm not a Savarna. I don't even know what that means. I've grown up in an urban environment without knowing what my caste was, and now I've grown up and found out, done research, turns out my ancestors were all what we would call Dalit who got pushed over to a different category. I feel helpless when someone blames me or my ancestors for existing, or even talks bad of my gods, I can't do anything can I. This adds to my anxiety. A friend in AP sent me reading on Periyar last night when I was about to sleep, I couldn't sleep after I just checked the name of the book, because, overthinking. It's extremely sad. I know my family did all they can to help everyone they could, like I try to do. It's such a complex situation.

People out there throwing out the terms 'Depression' 'Anxiety' like confetti to such a level that it has become extremely cliché.

Some people get depressed with low likes for their SM posts.

You can avoid sadness turning into something else. Get busy, learn something new, learn a language,trek (if you don't have money to travel), etc.

What we eat + childhood experiences / development. These play a good chunk on how we feel to be honest. Starts from the beginning.

I told myself I don't have depression when I first visited a psychiatrist (my parents tricked me into meeting one) and he went on to give some medicines (antidepressants and sleeping pills) and I was fine, till I decided not to take them. Then we stopped going at one point but I couldn't quite say whether I was depressed, or sad or just lonely. A noticeable change was when I started having suicidal thoughts, something which I've had at times as a child but became frequent by the time I was done with college. Adding fuel to the fire was the death of my friend, which on one hand made me aware that I was very much susceptible to killing myself, but later on I kinda realised that my friend shouldn't have done that. His cause of death to me was due to his 18 arrears he had, whereas a year after he died, I was in the process of clearing my 22 arrears via Online exams, which I passed

Ge off your phone.. and get used to not having any form ofninstant gratification.. once that happens, you'll see through all this crap around you..

we study what are told to most of the times we never do the job we are tempted or passionate of we follow some social structure that never existed we all wanna play it safe some people call to take risk at office space that is not your risk at all but to tame yourself to obey them end of the day post 40's we live a life with EMI and health insurance. it all started at our early age where we failed to communicate well bcz our parents are not aware of things and insecure,. very very few children or 20's grown human break this loop very few make friends that are worthy enough to reach passion rather making comparative LPA to office friends or dumb relatives.

I feel depression is a very word. People being in the state of sadness say themselves that they are depressed. Being sad is okay but feeling sad deliberately is a wrong state of mind. I firmly believe that people can come out of this dark phase of their life. If you’re genuinely depressed then please seek mental counselling.

I got really good at hiding how i really feel in real life because i don’t want to lose out on opportunities and friendships due to my mental issues. Social Media is a place where i can mostly be myself so i don’t have to pretend. I’m sure this is the case for many other people as well.

Comparison is the destruction of joy, in other words depression. Find your geek and embrace it, that will become joy of your life by lending a hand to those in need. Have a great day.

It was always there, people have started to get more aware about it now.

I guess one cause could be that, we are away from nature so much.. If you take a walk in the park filled with greenery, just 20 minutes of it,. I guess it will help.. For me, it has worked.. just a walk in park.. Sometimes even doing few exercises or trying some yogasanas has helped me.. in the sense that i feel something different in a positive way.. The time i spend with phone, checking LinkedIn filled with accomplishments from others, checking WhatsApp statuses about others, checking YouTube videos mindlessly all above factors bring me down...

Depression is not something which majority of the people think how it will be. You will never know what people going through unless otherwise they share it completely. And in most case, if they come to the level of sharing, they “

Sogama irukradhellam clinical depression illa da parama. People should understand this.

Bro world has become more competitive.. people trying to live up to certain standards by comparing themselves with other people and get depressed thinking they're not good career/life/family wise. And IMO people who have depression without any reason(breakup/family/career) is the most dangerous depression. That's the clinical depression that occurs just internally by body changes/hormones etc. No extrenal reasons whatsoever. They just feel empty and fight a lot of internal demons. People should reach out to a Therapist if they have something like that. Kudos to everyone that has fought depression and coming out the other end!! My heart goes out to everyone undergoing this Battle

Comparison is the thief of all joy. We live in a world where we are constantly comparing ourselves to others because of social media, news, media etc. Everyone has insecurities on the inside but we feel the urge to showcase our 'best' life in public Try and focus on yourself and what you need to do, it's much more healthy for your mind.

Yeah PMO induced the idea of depression in my mind. I was a person who was unaware of what it feels to be depressed few years before. Even now I don't know whether I'm truly depressed, i just feel bad for all those wrong decisions which I took lead me to toda who I'm and working to reverse it.

What is PMO? Google says Project Management Office. I don't think you meant that. Elaborate please.

Not necessarily, I'm in constant depression without any major scenarios like the one you mentioned. With late night overthinking and disoriented sleep, bad dreams, etc

You don’t have to be any of those things to be depressed. You can have everything in the fucking world and still be depressed, perhaps more so - you see depression higher in developed countries.

could you pls stop generalizing? I have my own best freind..she has 15LPA just hit her 30's., no debts.. she is deppressed like anything., eventho got an busy schedule and physically healthy life with partner. this is some un explainable scenario which could not be sterotyped.

Hi dick, I’m dad

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Hi , I’m Rick!

This ! ... It's okay to be sad, eventually you will get over it ... As long as you don't drown your sorrows with liqour and drugs, then that would turn into an endless vicious cycle .... But clinical depression is not a phase and unfortunately people confuse the two

I'm sorry for your loss. It's good you have overcome it . Life is unfair sometimes, but it is what it is. I don't know philosophy... So this what I could say. You are a strong person.

This needed to be said.

I just want you to know that you are going to be fine. It's not a lot but I am proud of you.

Feeling depressed is not normal.. i think you are confusing it with sadness.. On the other hand if someone considers high fever as normal human thing then your logic would be applicable.

I have MDD also.. and i couldn't agree more with you

Don't fall for that trash talk by the oldies.. these things did exist in their days too.. they didn't know what it was coz of lack of information or they just dismissed it

This is so much truth for me to know.

Hehe cool

Right

There is a demon at every level More you level up, you should slide/dodge than fight

This leads to me giving off a sad ish vibe on most days.

Me. Whenever I make a reel and it doesn't get the traction my older reels got I hate myself

Bro it's worth your lifetime living for and by the side of your parents. It's a blessing. Don't ever let yourself down and especially your mom down in any situation. I believe in God. And it's them. Our parents are our Gods. Not only for creating us, their sacrifice and efforts for us to live a better life is immeasurable , priceless .

You are absolutely right.

:-/ factu factu factu

Correct light ? Enlighten me please

>The time i spend with phone, checking LinkedIn filled with accomplishments from others, checking WhatsApp statuses about others, checking YouTube videos mindlessly This has helped you, seriously ?

Bruh, i'm just 22 and i'm all healthy and in ideal BMI. And i'm not an idiot to not know i have diabetes, it's the lack of motivation and repeated failures lead me here. I'm getting over this for real.

Feel you bro . .. been there ..once you accept that you have a problem . You will work it out .. will take sometime .. but you will get there

Porn Masturbation & Orgasm

yeah also they might have other problems...

In past good food, shelter, having a small family and a niche was heaven. These days, they are nothing.

I just said about the common problems..did I deny there aren't other problems edit:typo

Congratulations.

Thank you! Don’t worry naamalam tsunamileh swimadipom, seeking treatment feeling great 😇

No no. She helped me through my depression. Made sure I took medicines, took me to therapy. She just told me this when I asked why are we getting all this when they didn't go through it. My family has been super supportive, and have regular meetings with my therapist for progress too.

I mean how we don't grow or eat healthy anymore. If I was back home, I'd eat from plants in our balcony garden, or from a neighborhood mill, get cow milk from an aunty who lives down the road and so on. I'm on my phone, anxious and unable to sleep at night, I try keeping my phone away and I'm anxious about being unable at work or a commitment. This is a lifestyle change.

Smartphones well, yes ofcourse

Agreed! Learning this.

[deleted]

Yeah, I'm not a transformed person, but occasionally when I walked in the park or occasionally when I did little bit of exercise, something different i felt. Not that I push myself to park or exercise..

In that case i must say... Dude count your lucky stars daily.. not everyone has such a supportive family especially in such matters

True that about eating healthy.. and yes putting away the phone sometimes does just lead to feeling even more worse

Buddy even I'm doing CA lol

Yeah! I'm aware. My relatives have been nice. This started with the first time I got pimples and freaked out, my family was like we got them, they will fall off. Same with mental health, they've seen relatives go through horrible spaces without therapy or medicines, that's why they're more open to change. Also, on TV and news so many stories of kids committing suicide and so on. It scares them because they love my sister and me so much.

Yeahh! Exactly. We don't have the social circles they have too. Their best friends were their cousins, I don't even live in the same place as my cousins (who are all small so won't understand what I'm saying).

Agreed
