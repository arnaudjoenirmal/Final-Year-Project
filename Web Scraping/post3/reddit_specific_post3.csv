y3lgd8,Why is depression becoming common,"Every Rick or dick i come across only on social media is depressed af. But in real world I'm surrounded by positive and cunning people among them I feel depressed. 
So what's your take on this issue. Am I delusional or what I'm facing is common now a days.

Edit : See guys thank youu all for you responses, but i'm not depressed. i'm unable to focus on studies. Even for an hour i don't sit and study. But i have interests and can grasp the subjects if i did. Everyday pass by not studying and simply wasting time, the brain fog or whatever after i wake up.... It feels like a hangover, i don't drink, smoke.... stil this fog fades away by noon. At noon i have eat, after eating i will think just wait till 6pm. Then the 6 suddenly becomes 8pm. I eat dinner. After it is 10 pm so quick. Then sleepy sleepy.... The loop remains. I'm trying to come out of this.... I have replaced my smartphone with a keypad. And i'm typing this from my PC. I don't use pc often as it takes more efforts to access. So now i'm forced to, Social media and PMO is the enemy for me. And as i stay at home, i have lost the competitive spirit, once i'm out of home and go places, it feels overwhelming to see people competing for everything. But that's life. I was a competitive guy. Now i'm not. I just want to reclaim my old self. Hope i can succeed in studies and in life too.
Thank you.",Chennai,[deleted],1665726491,149,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/y3lgd8/why_is_depression_becoming_common/
