Depression is the prolonged feeling of depression, these Cases of depression are usually minor, seeing a therapist would help- usually there would
be a reason why the person is depressed I.e a breakup, financial issues. 

Clinical depression such as major depressive disorder is a more serve form of depression where therapy won’t help. And medical intervention is required such as anti depressant - in these cases the person don’t even know why they are feeling depressed to an extend it affects their daily life.

I think one of the primary reason for depression is lack of faith. The modern youth do not want to accept anything which is not provable through the scientific method. Most abhor religion. Some abhor philosophy too. God is simply a made up story and doesn't matter In there decision making. what is useful is more important than what is true.

y3lgd8,is9sr9v,[deleted],"The reason, the term depression is not properly defined in todays reality.
A person , who had break-up , or lost job or lost someone becomes sad and worries a lot about the things he lost. Which makes him to be sad all the time and this is termed as depression , but actually it’s a temporary emotional downtime which would get better if they focus on the goals and shift their thinking away from it .
This is what we see more now a days and that’s why the numbers are more.


But there are some people who are literally stuck in a problem or situation where they feel like they can’t do anything and continues to be in the same state for a very long time and that’s when things start to go south. This is when we need assistance to come out of it.


Coming to your point: surrounded by people who you feel are cunning can make you feel agitated, cause you know that they are There for their benefits and the thing you know about this but you can’t do anything and you play cool when they are around .
This is common now and just try to stay away from them.

y3lgd8,isauazh,[deleted],"I think this is a phenomenon prevalent and rising all over the world. Changing times are giving rise to changing cultures (economic and social) and the pressures to adapt to them. It is a mixture of latent depression coming to light (through social media) and the newer developments of it due to these pressures which also can be attributed to the value comparisons that ensue of one's own life to others in terms of fulfillment.

The addictive characteristic intrinsic in the design of social media leads to escapism and further reinforces the value comparison, both of which don't help us work on our behavioral issues. It is not to say that these issues didn't exist before social media, but as mentioned earlier, it is coming to light and is even being exacerbated through it. These factors are some of which are leading to a rise in declining mental health.

Some healthier alternatives for helping improve our mental health:

1. Stop following the pages that lower our self-worth. Limited and self-monitored social media usage and phone usage in general will help stabilize dopamine levels.

2. Quit Porn. Masturbation is healthy when it's managed properly, stick to your imagination and keep it to at most once every two weeks (personal opinion).

3. Actively working on our mental health through talk-therapy with a mental health professional, medication (if necessary, prescribed by a professional), meditation, self-reflection to truly address and work on recurring thought/behavior patterns that are detrimental to our psychological well-being (again this can be approached more effectively by openly speaking with a mental health professional who practices cognitive behavioral therapy).

4. Actively participating in creating and fostering healthy and supportive friendships, relationships, and communities, while cutting and staying away from relationships that contribute to further deterioration of our mental health.

5. Learning life-skills like cooking, doing laundry, and cleaning. Not only are they practical in use, but they also help with confidence in ourselves to be independent.

6. Getting into hobbies we truly want to explore.

7. Getting some good and regular exercise (even just walking outside for a while helps a lot, without using our phones).

8. Maintaining good hygiene, grooming ourselves (for our own satisfaction rather than for external validation).

9. Reading (fiction and non-fiction, reading self-help books is fine, but they become redundant and personally I think it's more effective for the brain to read fiction/non-fiction as they engage the creative parts of the brain).

Most important of all: 

10. Being kind to ourselves, self-parenting is essential in present times and a privilege our past was not educated about.

There is no benefit in giving ourselves a hard time by comparing our unique journey with others. There is no need to pressure ourselves to do all these things very quickly. To take it all a step at a time (but religiously commit to it) is to live a full life.

y3lgd8,isab0el,VIVEKKRISHNAA,"I told myself I don't have depression when I first visited a psychiatrist (my parents tricked me into meeting one) and he went on to give some medicines (antidepressants and sleeping pills) and I was fine, till I decided not to take them. 

Then we stopped going at one point but I couldn't quite say whether I was depressed, or sad or just lonely. A noticeable change was when I started having suicidal thoughts, something which I've had at times as a child but became frequent by the time I was done with college.

Adding fuel to the fire was the death of my friend, which on one hand made me aware that I was very much susceptible to killing myself, but later on I kinda realised that my friend shouldn't have done that. His cause of death to me was due to his 18 arrears he had, whereas a year after he died, I was in the process of clearing my 22 arrears via Online exams, which I passed. Next week at the time of writing this comment, I'd be in the convocation ceremony, and I don't know how I'd feel at the time.

This year my dog died in an accident, and my depression made a comeback. I couldn't get over the fact that he died so prematurely and I kept crying for months. Now, having overcome the five stages of grief, I have moved on while cherishing the memories I had with him. 

The bottom line is, while being sad and edgy has been normalised on one hand, there are kids and teens on the other hand who confuse normal sadness and being depressed with Clinical Depression. It's ok to be sad when bad things happen and it's ok to take time to overcome.",1665753947,2

y3lgd8,is9bhuz,thatonefanguy1012,"Yeah! I'm aware. My relatives have been nice. This started with the first time I got pimples and freaked out, my family was like we got them, they will fall off. Same with mental health, they've seen relatives go through horrible spaces without therapy or medicines, that's why they're more open to change.
