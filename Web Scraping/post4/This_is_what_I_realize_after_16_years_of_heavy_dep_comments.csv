1c9sm7j,l0nulyr,[deleted],"A person can only take on so many hobbies only to realize that will not cure the underlying issues. I did it all as well‚Äî running, weightlifting, crocheting, writing. Hell, even medication, and that sometimes doesn‚Äôt even help. 

I‚Äôve just accepted depression as a part of me and my life and try to enjoy the less crappy days as they come, even when they are so few. Most important is to try to anchor my mind into the present. My default is to ruminate on the past or worry about the future / neither are helpful. Anchor into the present moment, and staying consistent with therapy.

I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so upsetting when people (not you, other people) infer that going to the gym is the cure all - like pls shut the fuck up. We are all just trying our best.",1713739274,166
1c9sm7j,l0o9fjv,ConfidentClaim,"As someone that has been depressed for 20 years (M30), I relate to this on a very deep level. I've done all the things you are supposed to do in order to treat and minimize depression. Exercise,  eating healthy, hobbies, build meaningful connections with friends and family, mindfulness, journaling, getting out into nature, ect. The only thing I haven't done is therapy because I've never been able to afford it. I realize my depressive thoughts and emotions are illogical and are not my own. Even though I consciously want them to stop and I want to get better, my brain doesn't currently function the way I wish it would. The brief periods where I am in control are just temporary reprieves from my baseline. I'm afraid to continue living, but I'm not sure if I'll have the courage to end it all myself. There are days ( sometimes weeks or even months) where the only thought that gives me relief is my own death. Unfortunately, at those times I'm too depressed to leave my bed and actually follow through with it.",1713745438,45

1c9sm7j,l0pj231,chairman_maoi,"Likewise, I think a lot of people bang their head against the wall re medication, falling down rabbit holes and becoming obsessed with supplements, diets, cycling from one medication to another. 

No medication will ever work 100%. You will still have bad days. The medication got me out of bed, literally, and got my brain working again, but I still fucking have depression. Accepting that made things easier for me somehow.",1713768764,12
1c9sm7j,l0qv6s1,SnooAdvice3962,"this is SO SO true! negative self talk, shame, repeating thoughts are all symptoms of depression. you cannot talk your way out of depression and they all are symptoms from the ‚Äúsource sadness.‚Äù its like you‚Äôre a completely different person with a different personality and brain chemistry, you can‚Äôt control it. it‚Äôs extremely relieving when you can just be sad in peace. it‚Äôs so exhausting feeling guilt, sad, mad about being sad? like just let me be sad! giving myself permission to experience any emotion or thought helped me so much. emotions and thoughts are an experience, not a doing. 

also, what you mentioned about the shaking sounds exactly like TRE! It stands for ‚Äútension and trauma releasing exercise‚Äù and when i tried it with my therapist i had to be in a certain pose, and my body started involuntarily shaking for 15-20 min to release the nervous energy built up from trauma.",1713796089,9
1c9sm7j,l0pz1xe,soft-cuddly-potato,"Oh my god, you're so much like me üíî

I was operating under the assumption I was doing something wrong, that I must try harder, I work at 2 labs, have 3 volunteer jobs, do marital arts, have friends, go to therapy, etc. 

I wanted to believe I was lazy and not doing something right and that I wasn't trying hard enough because if I really am doing my all, then it means it's just time between me and recovery, and I don't want to wait. This pain is unbearable. 

None of the clich√© depression help bs works because I'm traumatised and this is the first time in my life I'm actually physically safe. My body is great at surviving but not good at living. I constantly feel the need to be in fight or flight, to be ready to fight the next big bad thing. I'm traumatised. 

I don't think my sad thoughts, I don't ruminate, I don't have negative self talk any more than an average person, if not less. I just *feel* sad and therapy isn't very good at challenging persistent long term feelings. 

I feel like I'm swimming in jelly and weights are all tied to my body. I feel like I was woken up at 3am after a long day at work to go clean up diarrhea off a floor in a far away McDonalds or something. It's all a sense of ""ugh I don't want this"" and ""ugh I'm so tired, I'm so tired, I'd rather just not do anything"". Everything I do takes up so much energy.

No amount of CBT or behavioural change or diet and sleep, or exercise changes this.",1713780767,6

It would only throw me into depressive episodes again. I finally caved in and tried medication. I found a medication that works and haven‚Äôt slipped back into that hole yet. I truly believe that childhood trauma and abuse of any kind, really messes with your brain. It‚Äôs trauma to your brain just like any other brain injury. Just never give up!

1c9sm7j,l0qvacs,SlayerOfUAC,"I've been dealing with depression for a couple decades myself (I'm 38 and it started in the single digits of my childhood). I'm trying to do all the right things too, and honestly I'm still low-key depressed every day. I always wish a car would hit me on my way to work or something would take me out. I truly hate being a part of life and the game that it is, and there's nothing I can really do about it. I work, I go to the gym, eat decently and cut out overly processed foods and desserts, maintain a sleep schedule, and yet the depression always lingers.

1c9sm7j,l0rmqq6,El_Cartografo,"I did TMS this last year.  It was a miracle for me.  50 years of symptoms vanished pretty much overnight.  I'm having to learn how to deal with emotions again.  I'm a 60 year old guy.  I cried all through Tortured Poets. My own memories were a little too close with some of those lyrics.

I'm not recommending. That's for your doctor.  I'm sharing my experience.

50 years of depression, two attempts.  CPTSD, 40 years.  Anxiety, started sometime in my 20s.  

Not joking.  6 weeks getting kicked in the head by the electric mule was totally worth it to me.  Meds, therapy,  SO MANY MEETINGS AND GROUPS, mindfulness, all saved my life, kept me functioning for all this time.  Keep going.  Hope isn't always visible until you're right on top of it.

What‚Äôs going to make you feel like you belong is recognizing fully that we‚Äôre all one big cog in the machine. A small part of something bigger. The grand design or whatever. The whole point is to learn and grow in the bodies we‚Äôve been given with the experiences we are given as well.
I‚Äôm gonna include a poem that I wrote and I hope that maybe it explains what I mean:

If there were one last path

One last road that I had to go down to reach my destination

The road that leads me to the rest of my lives
I‚Äôd choose one of comfort,
Of familiarity

The path with the most green
and the most blue

The path with the most vivid flowers you‚Äôve ever seen and trees that were as wide as they were tall

and I‚Äôd sit

And I‚Äôd think about how small I am
How small this life is

And how everything is inevitable and that we all will perish being a tiny blip in time.

Our lives aren‚Äôt a book

We don‚Äôt have a table of contents

And our lives are not made of pages or chapters or even paragraphs.

Our lives are like each letter of each word of each sentence of each paragraph that someone may never read.

We may never accomplish anything great like Einstein or Van Gogh or anyone worth remembering.

But our lives mattered. We breathed the same recycled air.

We‚Äôve looked at the same moon, and we‚Äôve laughed at the same jokes.

We‚Äôve loved just as fiercely and hurt just as deeply as every life before us; and every one after us

And after all of that

After we inevitably turn to dust

the cycle will continue.",1713825384,2
