1l922pu,mx9ekuj,GiftEfficient,"I lived one day at a time. Stopped aspiring to things in the future. Dropped my goals in life and tried to be in the moment. In the first period i just slept a lot. At some point i didn't feel the need to sleep anymore except for the night. And i started to look at my job, and I switched jobs.  That started to make me feel a little better. I then started eating healthier.  From then on my hobbies finally felt fun again.  It felt like a long time but the moment i noticed i got out of my depression ( which was at least 1,5 year) is because i suddenly felt a twinge of happiness in my body. It felt like i woke up from a dark dream, not as much a nightmare. It felt like the light went on. Everything suddenly appeared brighter. I smiled more, i got more smiles back. I started to chat again with complete strangers.  I really went from darkness to the light.  And the funny thing is, i still don't know how i got this depressed.",1749672672,5752

1l922pu,mx9ugsi,NudeSpaceDude,"Various things helped me overcome my depression that lasted several years, but the most important thing was realizing that I could get better, and then making the decision to get better no matter what I had to do. 

These things all helped me at varying degrees of success:

• Meditation. This takes practice and is frustrating at first. Keep at it and you’ll be able to give yourself moments of peace. A few minute break from the suffocation of depression is sometimes lifesaving.  

• Writing down my feelings, and trying to figure out why I’m feeling them. This helped me learn myself, identify stressors, and figure out what I needed to improve my mental health. 

• Exercise. This is such an easy thing to do in the sense that you can almost always do it every day and it helps immediately. Hell, if you’re depressed, it can’t make anything worse. 

• Talking to people. This one sometimes helped the most but also sometimes backfired. People are unpredictable but getting out there can help. 

• Nutrition and sleep. This does so much more than most people think. Eating healthy can be hard if you’re poor and getting sleep can be difficult for a lot of people, but try your best to eat a healthy diet and get 8 hours of sleep (9-10 if you’re female).

• Find a creative outlet. Whether it’s drawing, writing, making video games or singing in the shower, find something to get at least *some* of the thoughts out of your head. 

• Working. Having a job and focusing on it will keep you distracted and obviously make you money. Money can’t buy happiness, but it can buy a jet ski. (This is a reference, I know depression can’t be cured by jet skis {but seriously, it might help}). 

• Go on adventures. Even just going on a walk in your local park can help. Breathe fresh air, enjoy nature, move your body around, realize how small we are and that we’re just here to live. 

••• Seek professional help. This obviously can be hard if you’re under 18 or can’t afford it, but therapy really can help. You need to find a therapist that’s good at their job and is a good match for you, so don’t give up after the first one. Most first therapies don’t go well, but if you find a good therapist, they can absolutely change your life.",1749677315,32

Somewhere in this journey I stopped drinking. I think having to deal with being yourself all the time also helps. There's no escape or denial of your problems. So you can catch things much faster and reverse them faster.

Also I discovered you don't have to listen to the voices in your head, just because you hear them doesn't mean it's a real reflection of your mind - a lot of it is conditioned by our society, for example judging someone who is fat. You can also speak back and at first it really feels stupid but you have to build that muscle. I'm still working on it and self-love and all that and not putting myself down in every conversation.

I remember the day she told me that “depression is a choice” and I never hated anyone more in my life. But throughout time, I realized it was 100% true. The CBT triangle talks about how we have thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. You cant control (for the most part) your thoughts and feelings, but you can control your behaviors. You cant help that you feel depressed or think depressed things but you CAN do “opposite action” and do the opposite of what you WANT to do as a depressed person. With depression, motivation FOLLOWS action, not the other way around. When you’re depressed and you say “damn i havent cleaned in a while, ill wait until i feel a little better to” it is EXACTLY like saying “ill wait to go to the gym until i have abs”. The only way to beat depression is to do the opposite it asks of you. Truly life changing",1749671923,50
1l922pu,mx9s0tk,CDRuss0,"Posted this in another thread. Reposting here because it’s relevant. But caveat: there is no real “defeating” depression. Its like gravity. You always come down eventually. This just helped me stay on top of the cycle of depression, so that when I catch myself coming back down, I can get back up quicker.

Here’s my advice:

Ignore what other people say or do if it isn’t adding value or you don’t find it useful and actionable in a real, tangible way. If it isn’t useful, it’s useless by definition. Don’t waste time and energy on anything you can’t use in your life.

Get off social media. If you do this, you’ll notice that a LOT of people you are allowing to occupy space in your life will just disappear. Straight up. It will be lonely, but that’s okay. If they can’t be bothered to reach out to you, then they didn’t belong in your life to begin with. Focus on the real relationships you have right in front of you, and embolden those rather than fixating on parasocial relationships.

Lock in for 1-3 months. During that time, do all of the things you’ve probably already tried, or been told to try. Go to the gym, this is especially important. Read self-help books. Take walks. Get outside. Etc.

This is the most important step for me: 

Write every day. Catalogue your thoughts. Brain dump. Every day. It doesn’t have to be a conscious thing, but this is the key:

Start out just writing your woe is me feelings. If you’re feeling down, exorcise that. Write down your pain. Write down what’s hurting you. Write how you’re dissatisfied in life.

When you’re stuck in depression, or on a negative train of thought, it is a waste of time and energy to try to force yourself out of it using false positivity or making a to-do list or goal list or manifesting “motivation.” I’ve tried it. It doesn’t work. It isn’t sustainable.

Instead, you need to get your negative thoughts on paper WITHOUT the intention of trying to force yourself in any direction that doesn’t feel natural or instinctual. If your instinct is woe is me, then let your writing be woe is me. Write your thoughts without judgment or fear of judgment. Just let that negativity flow out of you.

Then read them. Doing this, you will be able to plainly see all of the things that make you angry, upset, or dissatisfied laid out. After a few days, you’ll notice patterns. Highlight them. Take stock of them. Organize them. Put them into clear view. Revisit them. Let them anger you. Let the fact that these feelings control you, anger you.

Then go back to the gym, or go on a walk, or whatever, and channel that anger into some kind of activity.

Repeat this process for however long it takes. Allow yourself to get angry, because anger and passion are energizing, but YOU NEED TO MAKE THAT ANGER PRODUCTIVE. You NEED to direct it at something in order for it to be of any benefit.

When you repeat this enough, you teach yourself the ability to leverage your negativity and channel it into something productive. Productive is positive.

A daily discipline of fitness will make you both physically and mentally strong. Eventually, you will notice yourself feeling better: more energetic, happier, and generally more content with yourself. That’s the foundation of confidence.

This works, because when you’re depressed, or down, or just sad, and you don’t have a clear direction about what you want to work TOWARDS, then you need to paint an extremely clear picture of what you are working AWAY FROM.

Finding direction away from something is just as valid as having direction toward something.

THEN you will have enough mental space and clarity to start thinking about things like:

What do I like? What am I interested in? What am I good at? What do I want?

Eventually, inevitably, life will ebb and flow and you will need to repeat this process. It isn’t a straight line. It’s a circle. And that circle always leads back to stasis in one way or another. You need to learn the practice of getting yourself out of stasis first before you can build momentum, and then momentum pulls you in the right direction.

I hope this was helpful.",1749676575,15
1l922pu,mx9c90o,Leaftotem,"I fought depression for three+ decades, and I can confidently say I've won a lasting victory.

Surprising tools, for me: 

\- When I'm going thru something hard and I know I need a lift to get thru it, simply forcing myself to put on a little smile, even though it feels off, actually helps. There's science for this: just the act of smiling, even if you're not feeling it, can release some dopamine.

\- Analyze your sleep, food, and physical activity, and try over time to optimize each of those factors in your daily routine. They each hit really hard when they're out of balance, so tuning them up can help a lot.

  
\- Secure a therapist who you can talk to about whatever you're working on in yourself. A person can only do so much on their own, but when you have a good specialist to help you it can make a world of difference.



\- Remember to take pride in what you've accomplished. Build a list of things you've done or that you're doing, which you take pride in, and remember to refer to it if you're feeling down. Even if we can't feel awesome all the time, remembering what you take pride in can help counteract runaway distress.

I’m seeing a lot of responses in this thread talking about “situational depression” and how their depression went away when they changed their situation, but by definition if your “depression” can completely go away by making a few changes in your situation, then it wasn’t actually depression, just intense sadness or anger or grief or any other related negative emotion you were having about something in your life you didn’t like. That’s why I think your advice is SO good and honestly has been one of the most effective interventions I’ve ever used with my clients over the years - reminding yourself that no matter how you feel at the moment, that you WILL NOT feel like that forever.

1l922pu,mxaobv1,fpl1009,"Yep, I think the only real way to cure depression is to understand what your emotional brain believes about the world, and deal with the root of what is causing the depression/emotions.   
  
Usually depression is your emotional brain/nervous system shutting down because you have overwhelming and **chronic** emotions - it's actually adaptive, since your system realizes that it doesn't have the resources to deal with these emotions right now, and they are too much - and that you need to wind everything down. However, if you never address the emotions, it's like everything is just frozen in time and stuck, never really getting resolved.

But there's some psychology concepts that I have learned over the past year or so that have completly changed my life and how I understand my emotions(i can't say for sure i had 100% depression, probably at some point but never got diagnosed, but have had chronic anxiety most of my life so almost guaranteed to have really).

1l922pu,mxdau6g,AhChirrion,"The sun is like magic. And it works.

I mean, how is it possible a star so far away from us is crucial for our bodies to have a good amount of D vitamin? Sounds like nonsense. Yeah right, the sun is magic.

But we now know that's the truth: our skin needs certain light to synthesize D vitamin, and the sun provides boatloads of that light.

The same thing happens with the sun, our eyes, and serotonin: when certain light hits our eyes, it promotes serotonin production, which in the evening will be converted to melatonin. So, by being outdoors early in our days, then in the afternoon we feel less shitty and more calm thanks to the extra serotonin, and at night we can have better sleep quality and quantity. Again, the sun provides boatloads of that certain light the sensor cells in our eyes need to encourage more serotonin production.

Look it up. We need to be outdoors, NOT just watching outside through a window. We need to be without four walls and a roof blocking us from the sun's light. Being outdoors under a shade is fine, the sun's light bounces off everything in high enough quantities to work its magic on our skin and eyes. And if the weather is fine, we can take even more advantage of that outdoors time by taking a walk in a peaceful, nature-surrounded route (streets with trees are good enough, but it's better if you could go to a park with more trees). And of course, this outdoor time is to be spent in the outdoors - not looking at phones or reading books; head lifted and looking calmly at nature.

Then there's exercise. It works too. Good, periodic exercise, or even better, a training program in whatever physical activity scheduled several times a week has mental benefits. It helps dissipate the brain's fog, helps with sleep, helps the brain to be sharper and with a better mood.

And another one: non-hostile, non-sad in-person human interaction. We're social beings and our brains light up beautifully when and after talking to other people even about the most mundane, trivial things - as long as they aren't hostile or sad. It works even for the vast majority of introverted or hermit-like people. Just find a place or activity where you can talk to other people - any people. And the objective is just to exchange words and have conversations. You can write down lines to later use in these exchanges - today's weather is nice! Those clothes look comfy! Don't worry about making friends, that's not the objective. There are no high expectations, no pressure.

Everything is very hard to do and seemingly pointless when we're depressed. But we know from the experience of many depressed people these activities help - they're natural medicines; even if they ""taste bad"", they work, so we have to try to take them regularly.",1749730995,3

1) Radical acceptance of failure. It's OK to fail.

3) Have multiple options of what works for you. The same thing eventually doesn't feel as good for me, so I need to have a rotation of things that make good options that work for me.

1l922pu,mxamvcd,fpl1009,"Honestly that view of CBT is valid. It's good for regulating your emotions, but having to do it 24/7 for something as chronic as depression or other reoccurring emotion is not viable. But it's pushed because it's tried and tested way to get symptom reduction - but drowning a little less isn't a great sell when you're still drowning.

More experiential therapies are much more effective for those more chronic emotions. Experiential because a lot of things you know about life, you learn through absorbing information through your life experiences. That's why it's such a cliche that therapists place such a emphasis on childhood - it's because those are your foundational years on how you came to implicitly know how the world to be.

If you had experiences that associated people with danger, now your brain has learned through experience, people = danger. That type of emotional memory CBT does a terrible job of targeting and changing. However, there are different therapies, that work to erase/rewrite the emotional component of your lived experiences - and those can completely eliminate the underlying symptom!! Like actual erasure of it, it's pretty mindblowing stuff, and should be more widespread than CBT I think. But I guess it takes more time/effort to dive into and investigate the patients emotional reality.

Also CBT is like swimming upstream against you have learned to be true about the world through experience. And trying to override it is very resistant and it usually doesn't work. Also it lacks empathy for your system, since even though whatever your experiencing might be problematic, it was usually a subconscious solution a younger version of you thought was best at the time.",1749686694,6

1l922pu,mxacqvo,JustALittleBitOff,"Not OP, but same for me. Shrooms were a game changer. I had a mountain of childhood trauma with resulting depression & anxiety. Wasn’t sure if they’d be for me at first so I bought them initially. After a couple uses, I started growing my own. Exponentially better than Lexapro & Wellbutrin with zero side effects. Stupid economical to grow after initial supply costs. ~$12 syringe nets 200-300g dried, which is way more than one person needs. Do note that it’s about 6-8 weeks from inoculation to harvest. Some strains can be a little faster. Can’t recommend it enough.",1749683235,8

My logical brain wanted to find solutions to all the world’s problems. And it couldn’t. So I’ve decided to solve the problems i can “see” in my nearby community. 

That helped a lot. Be part of something bigger than yourself. That will take you out of this capitalism is ruining everything dread cycle. And now it will be capitalism is ruining everything…but at least in doing something about it in my quadrant of the world.",1749729004,18
1l922pu,mxczkzj,ManBoyChildBear,"So you likely have something called “existential” or  [exogenous] depression which is different from a chemical depression. Dr K has a good video about it.

Sounds like you know the answers but want a way to repeat the behaviours that caused the problem to solve it.

If poor lifting technique injures your back, you can't use that same technique to repair your back.

If constantly texting whilst driving makes you crash, you won't reduce your crashes by texting whilst driving.

By the same token, if you keep running away from your thoughts and that's why you're depressed, you can't keep running away from them as a cure.",1749674724,8

1l922pu,mxdyo07,LetMeAskYou1Question,"So when I was in grad school (many years ago) I was in a lab that did testing on rats. I was told they only used male rats. I was kind of shocked and asked why. “Because hormones in female rats mess up the experiments.” I told them that was bullshit and sexist. They didn’t care. I think it’s gotten a little better since then, but I’m sure it’s still quite bad.

Edit: It’s ridiculous because male rats have hormones too. And, if they wanted to control that variable they could test male and female rats to see what the differences were. But that would be more expensive, so male rats were the choice.",1749738842,4
