"That‚Äôs the thing about depressing. Sometimes outside influences(bad job, bad place to live, poor health, traumatic events) can cause depression, but other times it‚Äôs internal, perhaps it‚Äôs an endocrine disorder, perhaps it‚Äôs underlying mental health disorders. Don‚Äôt scared or embarrassed to seek medical help. You never know it might be something really simple. You have to treat your mental health just like your physical health. If you sprained your ankle badly you‚Äôd seek medical attention. Depression should be treated with the same urgency and care. 

Take care of yourself"
"Don't pick people, pick a hobby then find people who also do that hobby.

Frankly, they don't give a shit what you did on vacation. ""I took it easy and went to the gym a few times"" is more than acceptable, ""I needed to unwind... bla bla bla."""
"The worst part is when everything looks good on paper, so even your own brain gaslights you into thinking you shouldn‚Äôt feel this way. But isolation messes with your head in quiet, sneaky ways. You‚Äôre not broken... you‚Äôre just lonely, and that hits harder than most people admit.

Start small. Like, absurdly small. One text back. One walk outside just to be around people. You don‚Äôt need a wild adventure... you just need proof that life can still surprise you. It won‚Äôt fix everything overnight, but it breaks the pattern. And sometimes that‚Äôs enough to start."
"Please get basic bloodwork done for iron, ferritin, B12, folate, and vitamin D. If you're not middle of range or higher you're onto something. All the best"
I hate going back to work from vacation. Everybody asks what I did I just say fish. I want to be like obviously I didn't find another job because I'm back at this shithole.
Are you me? This hit close to home.
Recommend that you go see a therapist to find out why you fear letting people in your life. You will never change unless you figure out the why.
"I can relate. It sounds to be that you are dealing with a combination of anxiety, depression and fear. I think addressing this is your first step. Maybe its starting with therapy. Lots of other things like supplements such as L-theanine and magnesium is a nice combo. Once you address these issues, then you be less afraid and more social, have more friends, and may even want to take some solo trips as well. Another thing is that even when you feel afraid to do something, try and do it anyway. You will find that it wasn't as scary as your mind made it out to be,"
Sometimes you need rest. Your vacation. Your way. I encourage you to change something up tomorrow. Go a different route to work. Go out of your way for something you like. Morning coffee. Big sammich. A tasty dinner out of your space. It helps me remember I can do this. Just keep taking care of yourself. You got this
"So you are at a crossroads.  Ghosting potential friends and staying in your comfort zone has led you to the point you're at now.  Which is ok!  But perhaps it's time to start putting yourself out there a bit and see what happens.  Yes, it can be stressful and overwhelming and maybe even lead to disappointment and heartbreak but these are risks we take when opening ourselves up and being vulnerable.  If you feel like anxiety is getting in the way of how you would prefer to interact socially, then that might need to be addressed if you aren't already doing so.  Best of luck to you on your journey."
"Depression isn‚Äôt logical. It‚Äôs a chemical imbalance in your brain, or some other physiological thing. 

And then you mention you have ZERO friends. Does that not seem like a reason to be depressed? Humans need connection. We NEED friends."
"Um. Being disconnected and isolated is absolutely a logical reason to be depressed, and if you include that on the paper describing your life then no, on paper your life is not entirely great, as you are experiencing first hand, because humans are social creatures.

Great step reaching out for help here. Please keep reaching for help so that you can resolve whatever is in your way of connecting with others."
"Help somebody, maybe even more than one person.¬† Volunteer.¬† Some people prefer to help animals or the planet instead.¬† Keep on trying to find your Purpose, and have patience in that journey."
"I'm the same way. I love staying home on my days off. Still, getting out for a bit of fresh air now and then really helps, even if you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúgo out‚Äù person. If you enjoy your own company and feel content, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. Just keep healthy connections with people who matter to you. And if you ever feel like connecting, saying yes to an invite once in a while can be nice too."
"Have you ever considered the fact that you might be clinically depressed, and in need of medication, and/or therapy?"
"This is me. I‚Äôve found that I have avoidant personality disorder, and that‚Äôs my issue. Consider therapy to understand yourself and work through this"
"Right there with you, bud. It‚Äôs ok to be confused about why you‚Äôre depressed. Outside factors can creep in without you even realizing it. One moment of being overwhelmed can turn into months, even years. Maybe someone in your past severely broke your trust or disappointed you. Maybe you sheltered yourself without realizing it. If you don‚Äôt have one already, I hope you‚Äôre able to find an amazing therapist that can help you find the trigger(s). Just because you think you shouldn‚Äôt logically have any doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt. Please take care of yourself üíú"
"I have seen this before. People strive too much for the perfect healthy life and turn into boring robots.¬†

Go to bars with people. Find some adventure buddies to go to new towns. Walk around. Get a little tipsy. Do some people watching. Go to a dispensary.¬†

Find common interests with people and go do them. Be silly. Who cares.¬†

Humans are social creatures. Go be social.¬†"
"Going out is stressful but it‚Äôs a good kind of stress, it‚Äôs the same sort of stress you use to work out. If you work out regularly you already have the mindset, just in another part of your life.

Enjoy the challenge of putting yourself out there, enjoy the little gains."
"Doing something physical helps me, the added bonus of building something and the satisfaction that comes with it. Maybe look into crafts, minor things around the house or car you can fix? Some free time, YouTube and a bit of tenacity can get a whole lot done. You'll feel surprisingly proud of yourself afterwards as well. Imo."
This is all you need to hear - You need Jesus in your life!

"Looking good on paper = living life on airplane mode. 

Get out there, travel at the weekends, sign up for new hobbies, challenge your existing mindset and accept new outcomes and possibilities."
There is literally no way out of this situation unless you start accepting peoples offers to hangout or events to go to. You can‚Äôt sit inside all the time and wonder why you feel this way. That is the reason. It takes time and maybe the first couple times out might make you feel anxious but just give it a few hours then make an excuse to leave if it‚Äôs too overwhelming. These would be the first steps. You don‚Äôt need therapy cause they‚Äôll tell you the same thing just in a ‚Äútherapist‚Äù way.
"Check your cortisol levels and vitamin D. 

Also, there are times when our life just is. You aren‚Äôt accomplishing anything great, you‚Äôre in your hamster wheel waiting for the next thing or nothing at all. Don‚Äôt stop fighting to find your spark of joy. For me, walks in the evening help. Turning on my favorite song in the car with windows down helps. A beautiful sunset. A deep belly laugh. Small things that give me a little glimpse that I‚Äôm still in there‚Ä¶. Just not fully rn."
"I suggest you really do start taking those solo adventures. 

Go to a new or cool thrift store one Saturday. Go get some takeout. Explore a cemetery. 

They will all change your routine and I think that helps your mind get the ball rolling and not get so stuck. 

So cheers."
Your life is supposed to have stuff in it. Next vacation go to Nepal and trek around the Annapurna circuit.
"We are biologically wired to be social. We need and benefit greatly from social circles. Quality of relationships is a key factor in happiness, health, and longevity. 
Keep going but spare time to find your people."
Depression is sometimes anger at the self. Are there things you are angry at yourself about?
Have you tried drugs or alcohol? Might be exactly what you need
I find you're thinking about dying concerning. Can you see a doctor soon?  It sounds like you're depressed which is a medical condition that is not your fault it's like being nearsighted or having diabetes or something. It distorts your thinking and makes irrational things seem to make sense. Please go see a physician or a therapist or something sooner than later
go to burning man
Lreuteri yogurt look it up. Get you some oxytocin.
"this happens, with everyone, just don't think about it"
"Holy fuck shit people, 
NUMBER ONE ! check your thyroid, through blood tests!!!!! or look up the symptoms, and then you'll want to get your thyroid checked! It's a simple blood test !
Check this before you freak out....please love you! Been there!"
Buy a fucking plane ticket
Logic isent feelings thou
"well yes on paper your life is great, but humans are social creatures and since you isolate yourself that brings down your natural instincts to connect. than your brain feels the big sad, so to say, bc there is no one reliable in your ""hunting team"". that's why even introverts go out or connect via internet once in a while, to maintain one or two meaningful connections. i understand tho you feel overwhelmed, maybe first try just replying to one person go out for a polite 2h for a coffee or sth you're comfortable with. a good connection is formed slowly anyway so there is no need to rush it and from now on going out every week, just try 1-2 coffees with chill people even from work, or go on solo adventures, that will automatically force you to interact with sb, go to an other city be a tourist or just pretend to be a tourist in your city. 
sorry this was long, but hope you can take sth away from it! best regards!"
You just need a mate. Simple
"I hear ya. On paper I'm all good, but then, who decided what's on the paper? We've been told and/or raised a certain way to fit into society and we should do this and that and then everything will be great. So we follow that advice, someone else's ""paper"" and left wondering why it didn't work.

We've become too reliant and trusting of the paper.

Rewrite the paper for yourself. You've tried what others say for long enough. Time to take a deep breath, realize it's your life and you play by your rules for happiness not someone else's. No asking anyone for advice but yourself because yourself knows all you need to know already. The choices are finally yours and that will always feel better no matter what happens."
"You are depressed because you spend time on the internet and reddit, instead of being social."
"If your depression has no logical reason, could the reason be illogical? Can you logically solve an illogical problem? What would an illogical solution look like?

You fear letting people into your life, but why? You said that your life has no direction and no value, that you're just waiting to die. What is the worst thing that could happen from letting people into your life? Is it worse than just waiting to die? We might be getting into that ""illogical"" territory again! But just because your mental state is illogical, doesn't mean that it's not a problem. Our problems don't disappear just because it doesn't make sense for us to be depressed.

Thankfully, illogical problems have illogical solutions. Karma, spirit, chi, mojo, soul... whatever you call it, you have to find out what you believe in. The illogical power that drives things that don't make sense otherwise. The important thing here is to be honest with yourself, which is extremely difficult. It's easy to dismiss ""voodoo"" as some kind of superstitious nonsense, but it's hard to admit that you yourself believe in some superstitions.   
  
Or, you know, you might just need some pills/therapists. What do I know?"
Why do you fear letting people into your life? Is it because you have a deep fear of rejection? No one can truly reject you if you keep them at arms length because they can never know the real you?
"If you have a logical reason to be depressed, then you are not depressed. Then you are having a reaction to your circumstances. If you feel worse than what your circumstances would dictate (aka not have a logical reason to be depressed) then you are depressed, and should seek help somewhere!

Edit: I have had the same multiple times, because relapses in depression are normal. 
For me it is important to know that you cant think your way out of it. It is also part of being human and being alive, and that has to be accepted. It is okay that you are going through this. For me it was also a good help to realize that my ¬´suffering¬ª was not unique to me, and that many people have come out of this before me, so therefore it is possible, because I am like everyone else, statistically. To get out of it, for me, required action. And it is like dieting. You are not gonna experience improvement after eating one healthy meal, it required action over time. And that is the hard part, but forcing yourself to believe its gonna be better at the end is the only way to stay consistent in your road to improvement. And dont go alone in this, tell everyone of your friends what is up, and then the scary monster of stigma is going away, and you will get support when you dont have the willpower anymore. 
Do whatever you can to get rid of this. Meds, church, parties, friends, volunteer work, alcohol (not too much) and fucking get out there. After months the thoughts and feeling will go away. The only way not to feel depressed is to not feel it. The only way to do that is to not think it. The only way to not do that is to fill your mind with other things so you dont have space and forget to think it. 
It takes time.

You are going to relapse, but then youll know what to do! Depression suck. You can do it!"
"On paper your life isn‚Äôt great. Trading your time for gold is part of life, not all of life. Trading your time for health is part of life, not all of life. Worrying about what other people think shows little self esteem or confidence or self belief. 

You didn‚Äôt mention nature. 
You didn‚Äôt mention spirituality (not religion).
You didn‚Äôt mention anything creative. 

It‚Äôs okay to have a limited or even non existent social life, plenty souls are in good company alone. But this doesn‚Äôt sound like your case. Same goes for traveling, not all need or desire this.

Modern man knows very little. And the suggestions you‚Äôve received in here are okay for the system and society we‚Äôre in today. That system is insane though, and their suggestions will only help make the insane more palatable.

You suffer from spiritual malaise. We are spiritual beings dominated by our intellect & constantly overwhelmed & reacting to our environment. It‚Äôs easy to forget to feed our souls- and live as a robot. Simply as a machine, doing what we ‚Äúthink‚Äù we should be doing. But if you zoom out, is it thinking or reacting? Or closer to autopilot? Work- eat- lift- sleep. And you wonder why it‚Äôs unfulfilling?

It‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre realizing money & health aren‚Äôt your answers. They are part of it, but much is missing. And nothing can get better until this is understood.


When I was unwell & waking up to what you are waking up to, an older gentleman told me what a healer would ask troubled souls that would come to him for help:

When was the last time you were barefoot on the ground? Or sat around a campfire watching the stars? (Nature)

When was the last time you danced with someone you love? 

When was the last time you felt inspired?

When was the last time you created anything? (Writing, drawing, building)

From how you answered, he gave you prescription: find time for those things and report back how you feel a month later.

Feed your soul & look inward. I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre waking up. What a journey you‚Äôre about to embark on."
"talk to a professional about learning to deal with this type of isolation. It's a fairly easy process, you just have to be willing to WANT to make a change. Best of luck!"
"Maybe try therapy or somewhere there for a first  impression meet up with a therapist that diagnoses you. That helped me a lot to find out that i was depressed and then i got into therapy, which helped me a lot. 
Of course you can try to do all the other things people mentioned here but that won‚Äôt help you in the long run. 
It‚Äôs not a shame to visit a therapist and you shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about it."
">claims to have no logical reason to feel depressed

>claims to lack one of the most fundamental components of the human experience

I really wish people would cease this notion of social lives not being a necessity. Sure, you don‚Äôt need one to survive, but you do need one to live.

Life has no meaning because you treat yourself like a robot. Social lives, among many things, is one of the key characteristics that sets us apart from machinery.

Furthermore, humans are chemical creatures, and chemical imbalances can cause things like depression.¬†"
How do you skeep? Check if you have an apnea. I'm serious. Bad sleep maybe a culprit of the depression.
You have to change into a different person. You have to do different things.
"Depression is illness. There is no logic in it, and there isnt any reasons that you need to have to get it. It is not your fault!  
Please if you can, talk to some mental health profesional. Ask someone to help you find them if it is too hard for you. You can literally get new chance for live!"
"Brother, have you seen a specialist? Depression is a specialist at quietly working to make us believe we have no taste or desire to do something.

Take a short trip; it doesn't even have to be far. Enter places to visit near your location into the search engine; you're sure to find something you didn't know about.

Don't try to make big changes right away; make small ones. The sum of these small actions changes the way your brain works.

Don't be anxious about answering questions about your social life; you don't owe anyone explanations. Choose a generic answer and use that to respond.

Keep exercising, drink water, and see a specialist who can help you. And don't forget about the small changes.

This is a long battle, but I trust you and I know you'll make it through."
"I don't see any problem, your job is your life. Everything is going as predicted by the company that owns your time. Its better this way, since you will now work more, and not need a pesky vacation. Its not like you did anything on it anways... Your better off working till you no longer can work.

Its all going as planned."
"social isolation slowly rots me. its good to stand on your own two feet, but nothing beats a good partner or great friends and family. Also: you said you don't drink or do drugs. Maybe live a little bit, in moderation?"
"Have you tried drugs though? Nothing hard, just like some lsd or shrooms?"
"Maybe see a therapist about some social anxiety? If you find it much easier to be alone, it seems to me like there's something laborious to you about talking to others. Stressing about what you're going to tell people at work is a great example. 

I can certainly relate to social isolation, and how that alone is more than enough to cause some dangerous depression. We have a biological need to have some social fulfillment, just need to find a way to get It. 

Opening yourself up now to some probably uncomfortable changes can make your life down the road easier for you. You'll probably have to make some space and concessions, some changes to what you find comfortable now, but depression is a biological signal that what we've been doing isn't working for our needs."
"yeah, having everything ‚Äúright‚Äù on paper doesn‚Äôt stop loneliness from hitting hard. isolation turns into a loop‚Äîscary to break, but even one small reply or hangout can start shifting things. you‚Äôre not broken, just stuck."
"I'm on anxiety drugs and it has helped massively with my depression and anxiety. My life has turned upside down for the best, I still don't socialise!!! But that's more for personal reasons than I used to which was exhaustion. I have passed my driving test ans gone abroad on a plane!! All without a panic attack or the emotional weight pulling me down."
"See your first paragraph is already a lie. You said on paper your life looks great. The job, money, health, etc. but before I even got to paragraph 2 I said to myself ""let me guess no gf? No friends?"" And then I read the next paragraph and ya lol. So if you have no social life and no partner... How is your life looking great on paper?? You say you have no reason to be depressed and then mention basic things.. I have food, I have water, I have money, I have good health. And???? Are those the only things that are responsible for happiness. No lol. You know exactly why your depressed. Work on it"
"Become a volunteer. The reason is that this will give you social contact without pressure. The lack of social contact is probably the cause of the depression.
I volunteer at a food bank, and this has helped me at great deal with my own depression."
"Check your diet. Bad gut health is directly related to depression. Avoid seed oils like it's the plague. 

I would also suggest picking up meditation. 10-15 minutes a day is enough. But that's a long term project."
"Get a bicycle and hit the road - it's mental therapy). Also, there are a ton of riding groups where you'll meet some great people.  Obviously I'm a cycling nerd but it works wonders both physically and mentally."
Maybe you need a pet!
"I suffer from depression too and sometimes it just hits me. It‚Äôs a legitimate mental condition that doesn‚Äôt often require something bad happening in order to manifest.

People with chronic pain can have it manifest while relaxing in a comfortable position. People with PTSD can have symptoms manifest while in a nice calming quiet atmosphere.

It‚Äôs why it bothers others like me when someone says, ‚ÄúWhat could you possibly be depressed about?‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to be sad to experience depression."
"What do you mean you have no logical reason to be depressed? You just listed literally ten reasons. Put some work in bud, no one gets happy by living like that"
"Hey OP,

I was in literally your shoes last year, and I even had a loving wife and community of friends. I say that not to boast, but to say that depression doesn‚Äôt discriminate. In my case it was extremely internal in the way that my thoughts manifested and the way I believed internal lies/truths(falsehoods I believed). This goes beyond ‚Äújust think positive!‚Äù 

The brain does what it does well and constant automatic negative thoughts (look it up if curious) eventually trained my brain to make the pathways for my ANTs to happen easier. 

I don‚Äôt know your life, but here is what worked for me.
1. Talk therapy with a good therapist. This might take a bit, but commit to this if you can only commit to one thing. Mine had me work on cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance based therapy and it helped me a ton.
2. I got on lexipro to help me through the really rough time (I was having suicidal thoughts which freaked me out and made everything worse). This is not a catch all for me but a helper to use IN CONJUNCTION with talk therapy.
3. Force yourself to go out into the community. I started volunteering at my HOA‚Äôs pond and cleaning it up. I also go to magic the gathering commander Sundays at my local game shop and run a Daggerheart campaign on the side. You don‚Äôt have to do all of this, but learning something new or having ‚Äúsomewhere to be‚Äù helps. 
4. You‚Äôre not alone. Depression is tough. You won‚Äôt be stuck in your worst days forever. Some days are good, others suck. Accept it and have grace on yourself. You‚Äôll be ok.

Signed, some internet stranger who cares"
"I feel you.  My social life is non-existent, no friends that I normally talk to besides some family. I'm married but, I might as well be single. People on Facebook, Twitter (screw Elon, it is always Twitter to me), or other ""social media"" do not count as social as everyone thinks.

I have what is a good job in my field, finally found the job but, meh, nothing really excites me anymore. It just feels like day rinse and repeat, over and over.  I work all day, come home there is billion things to do around the house, it never ends. Like this is all what life is about?  It's been like this forever. Travel, do anything? I decided to have kids and a wife with a house, so as I make fair money, I am broken because of all the extra stuff...

I think I am actually looking forward to death, I will not do anything to harm myself (no time for that bullshit) but, I think it will be finally a relief when I take my last breath.

Here we go again, put a smile on when I don't want to talk to you.... over and over...

and I drink on the weekend, it's my only relief from life...."
"My thoughts are that there are 2 types of people: people who find happiness making themselves happy and people who find happiness making others happy. There‚Äôs overlap but if you find living for yourself to be not enough to find meaning, try providing service or another- involvement in Pet shelters, soup kitchens, hospital volunteer work, or side job in something with social contact. 
If living for yourself is more meaningful, do a service to yourself: A class to expand a skill set, a project to improve your house or yard. 
Meaning and legacy are overlooked goals as we grow up and often need a period of trial and error, self discovery, ‚Äúlearning about ourselves‚Äù in different situations to see what experiences give us most satisfaction."
"Team sports are one of the best ways to make friends, get out of your ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù zone and also have fun. 
If you like a specific sport, look for local amateur teams/leagues, pickup games to join."
Join a non-profit you believe in. You will help others and you will probably find friends among your covorkers.
"Human beings are social animals. Social interaction is a human need to feel alive, not unlike your need for food and water.


You have perfectly logical reasons to feel depressed. There are tools out there in mental health care with, say, a therapist you can access to help you process and learn how to be social again. We believe in you!"
"History is edging toward World War 3, with the end of pax americana and looming environmental collapse. Sooner or later there will be plenty to get involved in on either side, as people get used to a new US domestic police force devoted to Gestapo tactics."
Social connections are important. On paper that‚Äôs really the only thing missing.
"Start asking random people for their best stories, the question also works in groups. If you don‚Äôt have one, ask for their advice on where/how to manifest one. Being curious and expressing enthusiasm (if you feel it) is all you need to make friends. Being rudderless sucks. If that doesn‚Äôt work, ask them what their favorite thing to complain about it - then listen and show interest without judgement, agree if you do.

Travel to Amsterdam, stay in a highly rated hostel downtown, buy a bunch of beers (NA beers for you), sit in the common area, and start drinking and sharing. If asked, tell people you‚Äôre ‚Äúpassion hunting‚Äù and ask them about theirs. I mended a broken heart in a fantastically silly weekend there.

If you‚Äôre open to it, listen to some podcasts on psychedelic assisted psychotherapy (ep. 66 of Tim Ferriss Show), or watch Blocks by Neal Brennan on Netflix. Even if you don‚Äôt want to partake yourself, the magic like efficacy of curing depression, anxiety, PTSD, trauma, addiction, etc - just the IDEA that healing can be so simple, might spark some hope momentum."

Find a good church! Baptist or Presbyterian. They will welcome you and probably feed you too! Even of you‚Äôre an introvert it‚Äôs worth it.
See a dr. From the outside my life is amazing. But I was still despondent of not dissociating much of the time. I waited until 25 to talk to someone. It took several medication trials to find what worked for me and even at 36 I have to give myself grace but there is no shame in talking to someone about this and trying out meds. Science is here to help !
"Welcome to life.¬†




You are unlikely to change if you havent hit rock bottom.




You are afraid of letting people in because you care too much. People who have been through hell in back, are able to put things in perspective, so meeting people and making friends is no big deal.




If your life is easy and comfortable, you wont have the motivation to change.




The real answer is to do the hard and uncomfortable things by your own will. Force it. Feel it. Doing uncomfortable hard things is how you will turn this around.




You are depressed because you feel something is missing in your life. A social life. The reality is, adding a social life wont solve it either. But, it is still important.




People try to give too much meaning to life. They take it too seriously, and so get depressed when they cant find some greater meaning or cause.




The best you can do in life is meet the needs that a human needs.




1. Have some sort of work/job/hobby you feel proud of




2. Have people in your life that you care about and that care for you.




3. Dont put too much weight on people when they flake on you, or let you down. Because they will, let you dont either way.




4. Unless you have people actively trying to hurt you. Juat forgive them. Its a waste of energy to stay angry at people.




5. Maintain your health, to avoid complications as you get older.




And thats about it. You can add extra things like bucket lists, goals, religion, more education etc... if you want to.¬†




But, the reality is. You have everything you need right now to be happy. With or without friends, or any particular thing. The only thing holding you back is your current belief that something is missing. I think that is a side effect of thw luxury of today where we have way too much free time on our hands, moreseo than any other time in history."
"Embrace the isolation and drive deeper into it. Reassign it a positive meaning... it's your mind's way of inviting you to get to know yourself on a deeper level. Meditate. All you need is within you. This may seem like mumbo jumbo, but meditation pulled me out of anxiety and depression.

Guided meditations on youtube are great to start. It is a practice, so a little each day is better than an infrequent perfect meditation.

Hugs ü´Ç"
"It sounds like this is a hard time for you at the moment. Good on you for reaching out, and I encourage you to seek counseling or similar professional help to establish an external support, understand yourself better and help guide others parts of yourself. Speaking about your feelings can really help in and of itself.¬†


It's a great idea to avoid antidepressant medication etc before you've had a good few sessions with that counselor or psych.¬†


Have a look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs. These are all realms we need to feel at home in the world. It sounds like you've done a great job establishing your safety and psychological needs with a good job and health, but you identified that social life isn't working well right now. As others have suggested, a hobby with a physical community is a great way to meet new people and learn new skills. Since you're fit, you might go bouldering or rock climbing, join a team sport or a weekend running club/meet up near by. Other interests of yours would have local communities you can get involved in - be it physical, creative, political, volunteer for those doing it tough or any other. Being involved in a community can bring so much joy, purpose and connection.


Brain dumping and journaling can be a real relief when feeling overwhelmed or anxious and can help guide talk therapies. This can also be a good space to practice self compassion and non-judgemental self-talk.¬†


Understanding depressive experiences through a biopsychosocial model (have a look at this as well) can ground these experiences in more tangible needs/actions/realms for us to better make sense of where we are and why.¬†


One great part I'm noticing about your story is that people do reach out. People that do this are really special to those that are having a hard time socially. They can be a lifeline and they're doing it because they care about you and are interested in who and how you are. If you know them a little, tell them you have a hard time replying to messages, or you could call them, and organize to get a coffee or some food. You can even pay if you like! Others reaching out tells me you're likable, which really helps with all the social stuff.


You are worth investing this effort and money (in the case of therapy or exploring interests) into. And you are capable of starting this personal project!"
"Good job sharing, that was brave of you. Keep it up.¬†"
Check your testosterone levels.
"Do you go to church? If you don't, I recommend locating a church. The hole that you're trying to fill can only be filled with Jesus. Jesus is the one who provides what we need."
"There are different situations but one way to look at it is that depression is your body‚Äôs way of shocking the mind and forcing it to try other solutions. There‚Äôs something wrong in your environment, and your body  knows it, though your conscious mind is blocking you from progressing. So your body puts you in depression until you sort it out. I am experiencing this now during a temporary but long separation from my family. My mind knows they‚Äôre coming back, but my body is freaking out and keeps making me feel bad.

You just need to start doing the things you know you need to do. I suggest you talk with something like chatgpt ( personally i use Grok.com) about it. Ask it to take the role of a CBT Counsellor. That‚Äôs just a quick freebie though, if it doesn‚Äôt help you might need a human. In any case, what they will tell you is just to do tiny tiny things first. Little steps in the right direction, and then increase from there. For me, having to do all this house maintenance while the fam are away, it means just committing to 5-10 minutes of work at a time and chipping away at it. In your case, it could be spend time with someone once a week, send a personal message once a week. 

You can also try volunteering to befriend old people. That will give you a nice little controlled environment where you will get paired with someone and just sit with them for an hour a week. They will appreciate the company and you can exercise your social. 

Not everyone has to be social either. I am not particularly social, but I found a girl (be the man your dream girl would marry), and I have found a variety of hobbies that I enjoy. They draw me back to society in quite niche contexts. These I also try to avoid, but the love of the hobby and wanting to connect with like minded people drives me out.

Hope any of that helps."
I‚Äôm the same. Have been lonely for a long time and often lie when people ask what I did or what my plans are.
"I am so sorry. 
It sounds just like me when I first got depression. Then later, I had social anxiety.
  It's rough. Depression isn't exactly what most people think. It's lack of appetite, sleep, stress and more. Know that there are many many people who you actually know that have a similar problem. 
   See a shrink, a good one. 
   I just happened to pick up a horseback riding hobby. Ironically, That helped me more than any psychiatrist or medication and it was actually cheaper,  too. 
   You get exercise, comfort from the animal, fresh air, and a casual group of people to hang out with or not. 
  It has been really great for me. 
   I wish you the best of luck. 
   When you get back to work, just say ""I mostly stayed home and took care of things and chilled. "" 
  I used to dread going home on Friday  night, because I knew that I would be so lonely. 
   I have all the faith in the world that good things are coming your way."
"Chote,

What you are going through is absolutely normal. We all have a phase of life where we don't want to socialise yet feel lonely and depressed. The good news is that you are otherwise active (work. workout etc.). All you have to do is shift your focus from socialising per se and pivot it towards doing fun stuff...like martial art, music, dance or any other activity that you enjoy. It will do two things- will remove the anxiety and pressure to socialise as you going there to enjoy your time doing an activity that you like. Secondly, in the process your social circle will grow that too without trying. Also, each hobby has its own life cycle I.e., bigger events, tournaments, gathering etc etc. So just by the virtue of partaking in some fun activity/hobby you'll open up a door of possibilities. 

Don't overthink, you are doing great champion just go out and live your life ü§ù"
I am still in college but I can relate to your social life sentiments :'>
"I. Feel. The. Exact. Same. Way. And my depression, ultimately ends up in me sabotaging the things that are going well in my life like a really good job. I had a job that gave very generous amount of PTO, and they even offered me a medical leave which I turned down and then ended up quitting my job a couple weeks later. I‚Äôm kicking myself for that because it really was not a bad job.

But I‚Äôm also dealing with some PTSD from a serious car accident where I almost died. Take care of yourself. It‚Äôs hard."
"Alexithymia much, it seems. Finding out that I nees physical contact for meaningful communication of emotional connection (and therefore learning tango), as well as psychedelics helped immensily. Best of luck to you"
"*""It's the difficult roads that leads us to beautiful destinations.""*   I haven't had any friends to see this summer either. Then someone invited strangers to a party and I just had to say I will come. Cause if I complain about having no fun with friends while actively rejecting invites, I am a hypocrite. And that's going against my values. I would also be self-destructive. Choosing isolation over connections. 

So you have to decide. Are you gonna push away connections for a false temporary comfort that leads to long term suffering, or are you gonna take responsibility for your happiness like everyone else must do including me with severe social anxiety and CPTSD?"
"It could be a chemical imbalance and require a prescription. Despite what a lot of people think, depression isn't always caused by something that can be fixed in therapy.¬†"
"you claim to not have a reason to be depressed and then in the same breath state that you don't have any friends.

My dude you are a textbook case of how people get depressed and the solutions should be very straight forward."
"It's not about reaching more people, but doing valuable things outside workspace. Try to join any social organization. Donate something, visit hospital and support ill people. Your life is good but you truly don't feel satisfied. See other people who don't have job, home or physical abilities and you will find a meaning for your life. Then you will find new people and new communities and you will be another person."
"Depression doesn‚Äôt usually ask if you think you have a good reason to be depressed. Sometimes it‚Äôs the happiest seeming people that are silently the most hurt.

It sounds like you have a good base. Workout, good job, don‚Äôt drink or smoke. You never know when everything will change. After my divorce, it was all I could do to get up and go to work and come home and cry my eyes out. But one day I decided I had enough. I was gonna find my soulmate and start the family denied me in my first marriage. And now I‚Äôm married to my beautiful wonderful wife and our nearly one year old son. But it all started on a day that started out like any day. One message. One match. And everything changed. 

I know it‚Äôs frowned upon here but that‚Äôs okay. But I‚Äôll speak from my own experience. Bro there‚Äôs something higher than us. People call it a lot of things but I‚Äôve come to know it to be God. And God sent me my wife when I needed her most. And He has been showing up ever since. Winning battles for me. Showing me His love in ways that only He can. I think if you continue to give it time, maybe open to the possibility of something more than what meets the eye, you might be surprised what can happen."
look at more like a mechanical problem. for whatever reason some brains might just not produce the same level of endorphines or whatever. doesnt have to be related to logical reasons or be about your life.
"The funny thing about the brain is it‚Äôs your mainframe computer, and people don‚Äôt give it enough respect. It‚Äôs the most powerful organ in your body. Its primary function is survival. That‚Äôs why if you‚Äôre stuck in a situation where you‚Äôre becoming hypothermic, your brain will shut down every organ it does not need to survive."
Check your gut health
Hit the gym brother. And find Christ.
Church life good for you
"Start drinking, smoking and doing drugs"
There is no logical reason. It‚Äôs called depression. It can be fixed if you talk to a doctor. Easily for most people.
"For me it's like I can't fathom trialing a medication for 6 weeks knowing it could make it worse and out me over the edge or fuck me up psychologically.

I'm at a spot where I don't have happiness but it's not bad enough for me to want to give up. But I could see a further imbalance causing me to make a rash decision and I don't want to get to that point. I'm in a ""safe"" hell."
"This! Depression has many forms, sometimes there's a palpable cause (the lucky case if I may say so, because you can point out the issue and know what needs to change) and sometimes there isn't. I'm sorry you feel this way. I honestly urge you to seek help on this matter, maybe you find out why it's such a hassle for you to interract and befriend people with the prospect of spending time together non-work related."
Agree with this. Activity-based friendships can be a low stress way to be social. And they can build into deeper friendships over time if you want. Easy options include things like pickleball or movies.
"Honestly I tell people I slept. I leave the depression-sleep part out, but I feel like most people would honestly still find ‚Äúsleep‚Äù to be a relatable and relatively enjoyable way to spend a vacation."
"This is beautifully said! You're absolutely right that the ""everything looks good on paper"" trap is one of the hardest parts of depression - it makes you feel guilty for struggling.



The small steps approach is brilliant. Here's what I'd add:



\- Set your phone to remind you to respond to ONE text each day

\- Try the ""5-minute rule"" - commit to just 5 minutes of social interaction (even a quick coffee order with conversation)

\- Consider that gym you already go to - maybe try a group class where being around people doesn't require you to initiate anything

\- When people ask about vacation, try: ""I focused on rest and recharging"" - it's honest and positive



You already show self-awareness and take care of your physical health. That's not nothing - that's a foundation. The social muscle just needs gentle, consistent training like any other skill. You've got this."
"Ever since chatGPT became popular people have been saying ""you're not broken"" a lot more often don't they."
Also magnesium.
This. My first thought was the same: deficit of one or several of the above.
And thyroid levels.
claiming it is just some magical imbalance in the brain is incorrect and actually dangerous misinformation.
"OP needs to get some friends, exercise, and switch jobs. 80% chance of success right there.

We live in a depressing world and people jsut assume you can go to work come back home and lay on the couch and magically be happy. Then they blaim brain chemistry for their woes.

Nah brah"
"Both of those are also literally the top two leading causes for depression, if you want a top three throw a sedentary lifestyle in there.

And OP wonders why he's depressed"
Love this comment and I agree ‚ô•Ô∏è Blesings and love to OP
"Woah, this is that nihilistic acceptance I've heard abput. 

They could add more to their plan tho lol"
It just feels like I'm not welcome inside a church.
"I can‚Äôt talk from personal experience, but I‚Äôve had a great friends go through that exact fear. A depression med that brings you down initially, but took them out further on. I suppose one has to make a decision based on the possibilities. I feel if you get worse you would stop taking the meds and return to your safe hell. But if it works‚Ä¶ maybe you‚Äôll be out of that hell. I‚Äôm not a medical expert in anyway, I‚Äôm just a physics student. But maybe getting advice from medical experts would be much better than a random on reddit."
"No! 
try the medicine. 
  I didn't want to try it because I thought that it would change my personality. It doesn't. 
  I would not actually want to go through life without medication at this point. It's kind of not worth it."
"Same. I talk about loving naps all the time. Secretly, I wish I could spend more of my life awake."
"Yes, a full thyroid panel. I had unexplained anxiety and depression (amongst other physical symptoms) and it was my thyroid."
"The goal is more profit, resource allocation and extraction points to. The more time working, the more profit generated. 

Everything else is a distraction. Remember every company is a family.  Because you don't need one. You have your job, and co workers."
Have you been to an Apostolic church?
"I totally hear ya. My doctor is very pill happy. I told him I had anxiety and he didn't hesitate to throw me Xanax. I never accepted it as I simply don't like the feeling of being under the influence. I've managed it relatively well without meds. 

My mom and grandma had clinical depression and both ended up on the same meds but ADHD, Anxiety and Depression are all very prevalent in individuals in my family and the meds for each of those make the others much worse. I'd love to feel better but experimenting with the brain is scary to me and getting the perfect mix could take years of hell. It could not but it also could. I'm lucky I can hold a job now. Couldn't imagine if I got the wrong combo. 

Life isn't fair and I've accepted what I was given. People have it much worse and I try to be thankful daily."
i dont know what that is

"An Apostolic church is a church that believes in the oneness of God. Put simply, it is the 1st century church in the 21st century. Below is a link to a church locator. You can search for a church close to you. Please remember that Jesus loves you and so do I.

Thank you. Once I get insurance again I'll consider. I agree if I could skip the trial part I'd hop right on
Thank you. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any churches in Sweden where I live.
