1mkhth9,[Text] I have no logical reason to feel this depressed.,"On paper, my life is great. I have a good paying stable job that I enjoy doing. I get 5 weeks of vacation. I don't drink or smoke, no drugs. I workout regularly, eat healthy and in general I am in very good shape.

However, my social life is non-existent. Especially during vacation. I have no friends outside of work. I am dreading going back to the office on monday, when everyone will be asking what I did during vacation. The truth is I basically spent it at home in my apartment or working out. I haven't traveled or gone on any adventures. 

I am not blaming anyone for my social isolation. It's 100% my own making. People try to reach out, but I feel overwhelmed even when I'm supposed to reply to a text, so I ghost everyone. I fear letting people in my life. 

I feel like my life has no direction. Like I'm just waiting to die. ",GetMotivated,VolitupRoge,1754615627,312,133,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1mkhth9/text_i_have_no_logical_reason_to_feel_this/
