"Well, I got older. Now I have Anxiety instead."
"For me it was a domino effect: 

Bought an eReader (Kobo) -> 
started reading books -> 
read The Comfort Crisis by Michael Easter, which made me more comfortable with discomfort ->
 started exercising more because I was more okay with that discomfort -> 
felt slightly better in general -> 
started having the energy/motivation to go to Meetups to meet new people -> 
Met some cool people ->
Cool people started inviting me to things -> 
I started exploring the world, which made me feel more confident and less anxious/depressed -> 
Etc"
"Counselling, lifestyle changes and accepting that depression comes and goes.


Edit: Just wanted to say I appreciate all the replies to this comment and if you‚Äôre struggling my heart goes out to you. some of you have maybe taken the phrase ‚Äúcomes and goes‚Äù to mean completely switched on or off, which wasn‚Äôt what I meant - apologies. I have a history or trauma and suicide in my life, and I also have PMDD. I‚Äôll struggle with depression forever, probably. However there‚Äôs levels to this, and that‚Äôs what I meant. Sometimes life is really tough and I feel like I can‚Äôt get through it, but I‚Äôm finally in a place where sometimes it‚Äôs really really good. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd make it to 20, 25, 30. I‚Äôm now in my 30s, married, doing my best, just a day at a time. 

I always have a little depressed voice in my head, it‚Äôs like it lives rent free and watches on sometimes when I‚Äôm having a good time. That‚Äôs all I meant really. All we can do is try our best to show up for ourselves. 

Thanks again everyone and sending strength to you all."
I quit my shitty job
Not being in destitute poverty.
"for me, it's not that it goes away, you just find better ways to manage it and cope with it. I have fought with it my whole life and had many low points, but as I get older I learn what works and what doesn't to keep me going. and sure, there are still bad days, days where I just don't want to exist, but I learn how to mitigate those big feelings and do my best to move forward. One thing that helped me was some visualisation techniques. it sounds silly I know but I was told that I should see my emotions as an incoming tide or swell of water, and that I should be a rock, and instead of trying to fight the water every time it came crashing it, to just let it go around me, acknowledge that it is there and why its there, but to not let it combat me, to just let it go. I really hope you are okay my friend and I hope maybe some of this helps."
Establishing a daily routine gave me structure and a sense of purpose. U just have to stick with it.
"I quit drinking and filled up my schedule. Left no time for myself (in a healthy way). I never give myself enough time to even think about how depressed I am.

Might not work for everyone, but it worked for me.

  
EDIT\*\*\*

Coming back to this the next day. I'm seeing some comments about feeling burnt out and life maybe feeling like a never-ending list of things to do and would like to elaborate a little further on that.

I absolutely get burnt out from time to time. I think that's just human nature. However, I think even using the phrase ""to-do list"" automatically makes it harder to stay on track. You really need to just incorporate small things into your daily life, to the point where you don't even think about doing them. I'm not saying you need to remodel your kitchen or restore a car, it can be as simple as ""7:00 AM - sweep kitchen floors"" or ""6:00 PM - walk the dog"".

Also, spend time with your loved ones as much as possible. Friends, family, whatever. The more time you spend alone, the harder it becomes.

Small victories add up, I promise. You got this."
Stopped drinking and became open and honest about my alcoholism.
"Wellbutrin. 

That‚Äôs it. I did lots of talk therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy on and off and gave it a good effort. I did get some relief for a time, but it never resolved it and it always came back bad. 

I finally sought meds and which I had resisted out of a stubborn and irrational belief that it was cheating or giving up somehow.

Brother/sister/sibling, let me fucking tell you, I should have sought meds DECADES ago. Fucking night and day. Best decision I ever made."

Hobbies from which I build friendships
"Very depressed since probably I was in middle school. Being diagnosed with sleep apnea was possibly one of the greatest things that happened to me. Took me until 32 or 33 (35 now) until i realized that im just way more tired than everyone around me. CPAP at night completely changed me. No more SSRIs, nothing. A day of depression is so rare now that i forget what depression feels like."
"My family is countless generations of depressive alcoholics and I fit right in.  When I moved to East Africa to teach in a small community off the grid, that was it; never depressed again. Like a lightbulb going off or coming on or whatever they do."
"Medication, therapy and decent friends. Plus my cat."
[deleted]
"I still have a little, but it's reduced about 70%.

Sitting and looking at my emotions is the only thing that ever worked for me.

Seeing what they were, how they felt exactly, where they were, any characteristics, and just paying attention to them until (usually) something shifted.

It would often feel like a thread unravelling - or like a bunch of little connected thought-energy strings all having been interwoven being shaken loose.

It's quite refreshing.

Then go back for the next emotion or troublesome thought. And just keep doing that until you feel better."
A small dose of magic mushrooms lifted me above it so I could finally see how underwater I was and what life was like above the surface. Until that point I couldn‚Äôt picture how to get out of depression because I had forgotten what it felt like without it. That perspective shift allowed me to put it to rest over time.
I was lucky other people who wanted to help me forced their way into my life even when I rejected them
"New career, diet and exercise."
"An incredible amount of drug abuse.

Somehow it all reset my brain chemistry and I'm just very excited about life now.

I wouldn't recommend my method."
Antidepressants
It was actually ADHD.
Years of therapy and also ketamine treatments helped me have some major breakthroughs. Fuckin miracle drug
"Prozac, being single, and being able to support myself"
Significant increase in pay
"Lots of work on Myself and lots of lifestyle changes 

Meditation 

Cardio 

More sunlight 

More grounding 

Not believing all of my thoughts

Less alcohol 

Less caffeine 

Better sleep 

More quality time with loved ones 

Stopped arguing with reality 

Unfollowed/deleted toxic people/pages who want to see you down. 

More time in nature 

More gratitude

Less screen time 

Kinder to myself  

Psychedelics helped me immensely too - they showed me that I‚Äôm Not my destructive thoughts (which created most of MY depression) and they just kind of reset my brain - no more brain fog. I‚Äôm now the awareness of my thoughts - not my thoughts.

I‚Äôm also much more mindful of who I give my attention and energy to. 

Letting go of dumb consumerism based ideals and beliefs that having more material things makes you happier. 

Less comparing to others 

Less unsocial media arguing with triggered damaged people

Haven‚Äôt felt better in 30 years. Have processed so many unhealed past traumas and worked on my triggers (behind your triggers is where a lot of your suffering comes from) 

More time doing simple things that bring me joy like - patting my dog. Watching the birds. Playing games with my family. Watching or listening to things that are intriguing and interesting.

Overall just more present ü§ôüèªüòä"
5HTP got me out of a depression slump and fixing my hormone levels helps me stay on my game.
"I realized I didn‚Äôt have the courage or moral fortitude to kill myself, and when I realized that, all those thoughts stopped."

"I'd been taking psilocybin mushrooms for a while. Sometimes recreationally, but mostly to sort of defrag the mind. Never excessively, and always with right set and setting. But I always had to return to them. 

A friend of mine suggested I try meditating during the trip. His fascination with accessing the Akashic Records through psilocybin aided meditation seemed neat. 

When I finally got around to it and meditated properly - in silent darkness as close to lotus as comfortably - and stayed with the Anchor throughout - I managed to clear some thirty years of negativity."
"The very idea of not having depression, of being ‚Äúhealed‚Äù or better, is so foreign to me. I have accepted that I‚Äôll always have it, and always be on medication for it. It fucking sucks."
"Exercise, sunshine, and LSD ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®Ô∏è

The tears are overflowing for each and every one of you. I see you.
"TMS - look it up.  Not sure why it‚Äôs not more well known.  It‚Äôs been an option for more than 10 years, with really positive results!"
"Medication, building a routine, small victories.  If you can at least wash the dishes, tidy a room or maybe get outside, that small victory is something to give you a bit of faith in your self.  

I'm pretty much accepting that I'll always be on medication now.  The few times I've not been I've been through some pretty destructive cycles and I've been stable for a couple of years right now, with only a couple of major episodes in the last 10 years, in comparison to there being the potential to just spin out at any moment."
"Ketamine. It changed my life with chronic depression. A couple times a year and it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt have depression. Highly recommend‚Ä¶ under the care of a doctor, of course."
[removed]
For me it was magic mushrooms.  They allowed me to own up to myself and take accountability.  Once I started taking shrooms I felt much more focused on my purpose and how to make positive changes for myself.
Exercise
"Vitamin D supplementation, improving my social life (it helped to realize that I needed a social connection to begin with), and therapy each made a noticeable impact in how often and how deeply I would get depressed."
"Massive doses of vitamin D, and six months of intensive therapy."
A CPAP
Shrooms ‚Äî not even joking.
"I retrained my brain.

My brain is just sort of wired towards anxiety and self-deprecating thoughts. I could spend days in bed just staring at a wall, hating myself for not doing the things I needed to do, and not being who I wanted to be.

At some point, I realized that my brain is a liar and its perception of me is not me.

So I made a deal with myself; do just one productive thing a day, even if it‚Äôs just brushing my teeth, and I wouldn‚Äôt beat myself up for 24 hours. That allowed me to interrupt the cycle of negative thoughts every time I found myself in one, by reminding myself of the deal.

Eventually, I started to fall into depressive cycles less and less. I still struggle with depression, but so have better control of it now and haven‚Äôt had suicidal ideation in years.

I also learned to celebrate the little victories. Changing my thinking from ‚ÄúI only did this small thing‚Äù to ‚ÄúYay! I did this small thing!‚Äù Helped change my outlook dramatically."
"TW: self harm


My now fianc√©e walked in on me self harming. I will never forget the look on his face. Never again. Seeing that look told me everything i needed to know about what would happen if i wasnt here anymore. It was the kick that got me to stop always looking for the bad and start trying to see the good. Like really trying."
"Gym everyday keeps the depression away.

Edit: Aside from the gym, just doing things. Im learning to drive, learning japanese as a second language, reading a bunch of books. I also figured out i love to cook my own food and make smoothies. It's all about staying busy and happy with something you enjoy, to prevent staying in your house or room for hours on end doomscrolling or playing games."
Magic mushrooms
"I wish my experience could be shared by many, as shrooms aren't for everyone, but for me, I attribute one night of shrooms with curing my depression. Ate a bunch, puked, watched The Wall, went to sleep listening to Radiohead.

Woke up feeling like a million bucks, connected to the earth/universe in a different way. The anxiety was gone, that underlying tension resolved. I hate spiders but ever since that night, I catch and release when I can."

Person with bipolar checking in: medication really helps when something is totally fucked with you
"Got a dog. Dog forced me to take at least twice daily walks. That and running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è are the only things that make my brain feel good. To clarify, I do not enjoy the act of running, just the feeling after"
"I got out of my room and went to work.

I was diagnosed with deps in college. I spent my days going from school then to the  dorm. Didnt make friends cuz I felt out of place, grades tanked cuz I wasnt ready for college, and lived far enough to miss home. Realized that being cooped up in my room was no bueno so I went and got a job in retail. Did all my socializing there."
Ketamin
Psychedelics and DBT. Finally able to accept the things I cannot change.
Divorce
"Starting putting myself first. Seemed to ""fix"" it pretty quickly"
Finding out it was actually untreated ADHD.
I left my husband. I've never been happier!
"Time, hangin' in there, staying off hormonal birth control, really prioritizing sleep as well as diet and exercise, and as others have said, acknowledging that sad happens sometimes and we'll get through it. Oh also, surrounding yourself with kind supportive people and staying socially active! And limiting social media.¬†"
"I stopped the meds, then realised what the real problem was and broke up with her."
"[IV Ketamine](https://youtu.be/nW21-AYY_fs?si=2ZcGo_GMg_Wg2NCG).

Literally saved my life."
"Medication and lifestyle changes.  I wouldn't say it's gone since my brain continues to function improperly, but both have allowed me to live a normal life.

Awareness of the symptoms allows me to nip it in the bud pretty early on when it rears its head again."
"Was in a clinical depression. Doctor ordered blood test. Vit D and B12 were tanked. Got B12 shots 1x a week for a month, VitD script 40,000 unit 1x a week for 3 months. Depression disappeared. I maintain with B12 liquid drops and VitD3 every day."
"My depression is still here, but it's not nearly as bad as it was a few years ago, I feel so much better now, and it's all because I'm able to be myself! I'm a trans girl, and am currently 2 years on hrt. I started to feel less depressed as my hormonal transition progressed.

Atm I'm suffering from hormonal fluctuations due to being on too low dosage of estrogen, which is causing depression symptoms, but it's not that bad and I can handle it pretty well!

But yeah, transitioning saved my life!"
"I discovered that my depression was caused by anxiety, and later that my anxiety was mostly caused by my (previously undiagnosed) ADHD.


ADHD meds have completely changed the game for me. Still need to practice cognitive behavioral techniques, and exercise, but the ADHD meds have helped the most.¬†"
Finding out I actually had bipolar disorder and getting treated for that instead.
"The exact right amount of mushrooms  that can never be replicated, and lifestyle changes. I got a dog that I keep a routine with and it gives me some responsibilities too."
LSD
"I tore two trees down with my bare hands, and the feeling of accomplishment got rid of a lot of sour feelings. I felt like Kratos."
"Mushrooms  
I'm still fighting, but I'm so much better off. 

In January I decided I was either going to find enjoyment in life again or end it all. I read about mushrooms and watched plenty of videos.   
I dove in and spent about $300 for my own grow setup. I have way more than I need now. You don't need to spend this much.   
What a difference it made. I feel back to being me again. I get stuff done again.   
Last year I bought the DDP Yoga program. In 12 months I did maybe 12-15 workouts. I've done 15-20 in the past month, and I'm on week 4 of a series. 

Also you can't just take mushrooms and be better. You have to do the work too.   
Find counselling. Find social outlets. Get some exercise.   
But I couldn't do these things until I tried the mushrooms."
"Ayahuasca. Nothing else helped once my sister committed suicide. I failed my very serious attempt only because I was found and it was my last shot, in my mind, before I knew I was just going to join my sister. The man that went into the tent and the man that walked out are two different people. My friends and family immediately noticed the change. I don't recommend it for anyone because it's unbelievably terrifying, but it worked for me."
"Building a strong support network of friends, family, or support groups can provide emotional support and reduce feelings of isolation..."
Getting off birth control
"Ketamine therapy. I live in Boise Idaho, and there's a wonderful katamine therapy clinic here. But it's my understanding that you can get it sent to your home in most states if there isn't an in person clinic near you. I can't recommend it enough. It was a final hail Mary for me because I was done with life, and although it took me over a dozen sessions over the course of 3 or so months, it completely 180'd my mental state and brought my lust for life back. I can't recommend it strongly enough for long term depression and severe depression. From what I hear, most people notice a change in 4-6 sessions. But sometimes l, like in my case, it takes more. It's been over a year since my last session and combined with medication to treat my BPD, I have my life to look forward to."
"I'm back at it after trying to drag this marriage carcass past the 20 year line, but when I was a young man, I escaped depression by listening exclusively to happier music.  In my case, I saw a lot of Phish."
"Prozac, therapy, switching to a job that wasn‚Äôt burning me out."
"Honestly, I got a cat and moved to a sunny place. It‚Äôs worked wonders"

Meds and therapy
Meds and psychoanalysis
"Medication , my border collie & the gym. Also taking toxic family members out of my life. People think you need to speak to these people because you‚Äôre related‚Ä¶.well I did. Don‚Äôt do it to yourself. Think of yourself we need to be selfish sometimes."
Transition üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Drugs
Lamotrigine (Lamictal).  150mg.  Life changing for me.
Ketamine infusions following the Stamford protocol. 4-6 infusions all within two weeks
Going outside for a walk every day. Getting sun def helped¬†
Being correctly diagnosed with ADHD
"Getting diagnosed with ADHD, and actually treating that. Turns out, when my brain works properly(enough) I enjoy being alive."
"Quitting alcohol and being selfish instead of doing things for others all of the time.  I was never an alcoholic but I drank alot, daily.  It gets to a point where it catches up on your health and you wake up and think 'ok time to change'.  I changed lots of things.  Like helping people out all of the time, at one point I just put on a brave face and ignored my own needs.  Also cut some people out of my life, I barely speak to anybody now apart from family and it's the way I want it, it's peaceful.  Look after yourself because nobody really gives a damn unless it's them going through it. People are ignorant, very ignorant to depression."
"TMS completely cured my depression and psychosis. 12 rounds over two years and I've had a year and a half of what my psychiatrist describes as ""remission"""
"Zoloft, therapy, and honestly my frontal lobe developing"
My boss got fired. It was a long 2 1/2 years until that moment. His boss was his buddy he's known for like 15+ yrs. Took a ridiculous amount of documentation between many of us to get him out
Stopping birth control
"Multiple factors. Working out daily, Vitamin D, accepting that society is sick and that it's not me, etc."
"Had it horrible since as long as I can remember. Was a very sad child and around 13 was when it got bad. Continued to be baaddd throughout high school and college. I tried so many medicines, different therapies, inpatient/outpatient/partial hospitalizations, etc. i had a lot of underlying issues to the depression, but could never work on those problems because I was always too depressed. I finally tried electroconvulsive therapy and it was the first thing that lifted the depression, I had almost 30 or so treatments and it‚Äôs been mostly at bay since! I did have some memory loss side effects, so that part sucked, but it was a huge game changer for me. After the ECT, I wasn‚Äôt depressed so I could finally work on all of the underlying issues to keep it at bay. Got on the right medication, did a PTSD intensive program, and have continued therapy for 6 years now. I‚Äôm finally doing better. I still get down but nowhere near as bad as I did before the ECT. It has a lot of stigma, but it was life changing for me! If traditional therapies and medications aren‚Äôt working, definitely talk to your doctor about considering ECT."
"Start with something simple:

1. Get off social media (as much as possible).
2. Walk for 30mins-1hr everyday. Better if around green spaces (e.g. parks, etc). Make this a habit (and commitment) for 30 straight days.
3. Get sunlight.
4. Take multivitamins. Consult with your doctor ofcourse.
5. Always activate ‚ÄúDo not disturb‚Äù mode on your phone.

My mother died just 3 months ago. These simple things keep my sanity."
"When you get really old, anxiety goes away too.¬†


I am suffering from Voyeur's View: I can see shit hitting the fan, but I'll be dead soon so it's hard not to look at it all as a TV show. Work issues just don't pack the same punch when looking down the barrel of retirement.¬†


If my kids are ok, everything is ok.¬†"
Getting older turned mine into major depressive disorder
"Damn dude. I flipped. Super bad anxiety from 14-22 ish. 22-26 (current), major depression moment"
Ha I felt that...my depression has been replaced with anxiety and stress.
This books sounds potentially helpful. I added it to my list!
"You're describing my stairway out of depression:

1. encounter some stimulus which motivates activity or engagement
2. change daily routine, and return to step 1"
"I have been thinking a lot about an erader, could you let me know what made you go for a kobo?"
The comes and goes is very important. Life events like deaths and/or illness can play a big part in bringing back depression as well.
"I came to understand a long time ago that I will never be an ""ex-depressive."" I will always be a recovering depressive, and I'm okay with that. It's a process. I didn't do anything wrong to get like this, it's not my fault, and sometimes my brain gets its wires crossed and its chemicals dramatically out of balance. But I learned the signs and found ways to remind myself that my depressive brain is, if not a liar, then at least more than willing to pick and choose which bits of reality to try to get me to focus on. It's okay to focus on recovering instead, because it's what I can do right now.¬†"
"Stephen Coogan has a great video where he talks about his depression and how he went back to Ireland to visit his grandmother and they were talking about depression and she said ""It's like a cloud dear, it'll pass."" That's what really helped me get a grasp on mine."
"Exactly this for me, too. 

Just note ppl, every brain is wired differently, though, and what worked for us may not work for others. If the motivation to self-serve isn't there, then medication may be needed, but ultimately, something will need to change, and what that is, is in your control. 

No matter what helps you, there's absolutely NOTHING shameful about what it takes to be the you that *you* want and deserve to be."
Its been crushing me for 30 years. When does it go?
"I would add medication (for most), routine, and having someone in your life to help when you first start ripping over into an episode.¬†"
"Mine was also getting out of the damn house, not to anywhere (a plus) but just taking a walk."
"Community, exercise, and self reflection. Or Bio-Psycho-Social. The trifecta of human dignity. Lots of pathologies arise when these are out of balance."
It goes? Let me know when that's supposed to happen
"Not much I can add to this really... I was deep enough in the depression well to be ready for that final checkout... but several years of CBT and early on meds as well to get over the hump.  Slowly tapered off the meds about 5 years after starting on them.  Now on as-needed only therapy even... life is good.  It took work, but also as I told my therapist at the time when we went to just maintenance check-ins ""I survived this... by comparison pretty much everything else will be a molehill.""

The thing is, it's real work to get better.  Do the CBT or DCT sessions, do the exercises, talk to the therapist, and \*DON'T\* be afraid to ask for a different therapist or different type of therapy (DCT->CBT or vice versa) if you don't gel with the first or second, or third one. Take and celebrate the small wins... all the way down to ""I took a shower today"" or ""I brushed my teeth""."
I was desperately searching for a new job to get away from my current one. Boss beat me to it and I must say I had no idea just how badly that job was affecting my mental health. I feel like getting the sack has been a massive blessing because I never would have spent the time unemployed so I could mentally and emotionally recover. The only downside is being crippingly poor üôÉ
I'm on the verge of swapping a well paying job for wellfare... bet my depression for a year or two and kept going and now I have burnout and... hello welcome back depression.
I did not realize the extend of my depression until I quit that job and realized how depressed I truly was during that time . Once I left I was absolutely shocked that I wasn‚Äôt miserable every single day anymore !
Telling a bad employer to get fucked is worth like 10k hours of therapy.
"Yep. Quit the call center industry after a decade and realized that the verbal abuse didn't actually ""bounce off"" me and it had been slowly eroding my mental health the entire time.

Once I left, even shitty jobs were a breath of fresh air."
Yeah I'm just moderately poor now and don't wanna kill myself anymore so that's pretty nice
"This fact doesn't get enough attention and all of the CBT, gratitude exercises, and pills in the world aren't gonna do shit for you if you don't have enough money to survive."
This. I was in a very dark place due to finances. Dug myself out and now realize how fucked I was over it. Money is an evil bitch.
"Keeping four digits in my bank account, to me, is effectively free therapy."
"Same. I thought money couldn‚Äôt buy happiness. Turns out that‚Äôs a lie because you need at least enough money to buy food, safe shelter, hygiene, decent clothes, and medical care or else you won‚Äôt be happy. Funny my therapists never figured this out!"

"I've been struggling with unemployment for the last 3 months, and I'm getting very depressed because of the financial difficulties. I have sent dozens of applications, and so far I've only heard back from one company, just to reject me. I felt better a couple of days ago because I got an UBER Eats driver account, so I figured I'll make some money and stay busy, just to spend 11 hours online and make $85 (Minus $25 on gas). That seriously set me back again. 

At least I don't have a mortgage or an expensive rent, hopefully I can get the $500 I need for insurance, internet, phone, gas, and electricity by next Monday, and I will have a place where I can go hungry for another month.

By the way: I'm turning 40 years old on July 13th. And that makes me feel even worse."
"If anyone tells you that money doesn't buy happiness,  they have never been poor."
"Money doesn't buy happiness, but it does take care of a lot of problems that cause unhappiness."
"I‚Äôm homeless right now, my depression won‚Äôt win"
This is the one!
It's almost as though physical and mental well-being is tied to our material circumstances.

"Love that analogy. ‚ÄúThis too shall pass‚Äù helps me a lot when I‚Äôm in a depressive episode. I also now know what my triggers are, how to avoid them/cope with them, and how to care for myself if I do end up spiraling (which usually means setting clear boundaries with people who don‚Äôt always understand what it means to have depression)"
"This is the real answer. 

Clinical, chronic depression doesn't ""go away"" (hence the chronic part), but you can learn to live with it.

Big hugs. Your comment gave me hope."
How do you stick to it? even getting out of bed & showering feels like a chore
"Was there anything in particular that made you stick to it and push through on the seriously low days? I've tried to implement this and as soon as I have a day when I can barely function, it goes out the window..."
"weirdly, one of the reasons im depressed is because everyday feels the same."
"Wish i could do this! Not having a routine is the crux of my existence right now, oh yeah, and chronic sleep deprivation. But¬†I'm pretty sure¬†they are connected to one another¬†"
"The trouble is that ADHD and depression are extremely commonly comorbid, so the ADHD folks see what you're saying and then experience a feeling similar to that of a muscular atrophy patient being told to hit the gym."
"Yo getting busy was the best thing that worked for me, that and finding a GF and now wife.  Like if I don‚Äôt have much time to dwell on myself I don‚Äôt suffer.  And it‚Äôs not as simple as it sounds, I do have time to myself and I do enjoy doing things solitary, but it‚Äôs different than being alone and letting your thoughts reign free.

Maybe I wasn‚Äôt depressed, maybe I was just lonely‚Ä¶"
"I came off of some quite healthy doses and really rocked it for a minute. Figured cramming my evenings with working on my house as I am a remodel construction fella would fill that void. Now I get shit-faced and barely get much done. I know what I need to do, but it's hard to break my current cycle."
"I went through a big breakup with my ex-girlfriend, nothing traumatic but the break up itself. But instead of the time I spent with her being lonely, I lined up my life quickly. Signed up for two soccer leagues, two kick ball leagues, and a flag football league. I also was on two hockey teams. I worked two nights of week so snuck in dating again here and there. Worked like a charm. Any time I move I know the routine of what you have to do to meet people and get involved in the community. Do things. Sometimes just showing up will do it, because you‚Äôll have an extrovert that will just drag your ass along to do things. That extrovert is me, but we will invite your ass anyway. You can be quiet. Just don‚Äôt be a fuck.

Edit: extroverts can be depressed and go in the hole as well. I‚Äôve been there. And being introverted doesn‚Äôt mean you will be depressed. I‚Äôm sure there is a correlation, but just a different perspective. I am not a psychologist."
"Worked for me. It‚Äôll be 3 years no alcohol on the 10th. 

Better sleep, more energy, dropped 25lbs without changing anything, healthier shits, increased sex drive, no hangovers, no hangiexty, better husband, better dad, better co-worker‚Ä¶ 

All those net positive changes by simply removing one expensive drink that just so happens to be everywhere you go, everyone is doing it and is literally classified as a ‚Äúdepressant‚Äù, made my depression disappear. Magical. 

r/stopdrinking for any lurkers who may want to take a break or check out the other side of life without the fog; it may be freeing beyond what you can imagine, especially if you were like me and drank at every function"
"I was a very happy teenager, started drinking in college and became depressed in my 20's. Went to a psych, got meds, did therapy, all of that with no results. When I got sober, my depression cleared in about 4-5 months, got off my meds, and I've been fantastic ever since. Took me until 33 to realize that my excessive drinking was the #1 cause of it."
"I went through a ten year period of trying different meds, them not working, going through withdrawal etc...
Was finally prescribed Wellbutrin, it's been a life saver for me. I just hope it keeps working."
"As a ""everyone is different"" anecdote, I was on it for about 5 years before I switched doctors and couldn't get a refill for about a month, so I was unmedicated. While I was unmedicated I realized that the Wellbutrin made me completely numb to my emotions--I was stable, in that I didn't have any suicidal ideations or anything of that nature, but I was pretty much a husk of a person. After it left my system after a couple weeks I felt my emotions so much more intensely and thoroughly, for better or worse, albeit, my thoughts got dark at times. 

Nowadays I'm trying different dosages to find a balance between being stable and being capable of feeling my emotions."
"Wellbutrin, as cliche as it may sound, saved my life. I was severely suicidal, like I had a plan a and a plan b even a plan c. Meds and talk therapy have been amazing."
"YES! 
I (36F) started them in March, after i had hit emotional rock bottom, about to check myself into a clinic so I don't do anything stupid. 

I. Am. Indescribably. Happy. That. I. Got. Them. 

Just as you say. Fucking night and day. And hell yes i wish I had gotten them sooner. But i also felt like it was ""taking the easy route"". With my mom being a cognitive behavioral psychologist, made it even harder. She is anti meds for the most part. 
But heck apparently my brain chemistry was so messed up at this point, that i couldn't talk myself out of it.  I feel actually reborn. Like I'm given a second chance to have a good life. 

It felt like a curtain lifted. A curtain that (looking back) has been getting thicker and thicker for at least 6 years. I could see less and less through it but it happened so gradually that i hardly noticed and always accepted it as normal that every day felt just a little worse than the one before. 
I have no side effects so far. How about you all? I lost some weight and have less appetite, I'll have to have an eye on that (went from 63 kg to 56) so all is still fine. 
Another positive side effect is that i smoke less.

Edit: 
And a little add after reading some comments: 
it doesn‚Äôt make me feel numb at all. It's the opposite. I can finally feel a full range of emotions. Whereas before everything was numb, muted and dark now there are nuances, facettes, sunshine. I can laugh. And love. I have hope and trust. 
Started meds in March, in may i finally got into a committed relationship with my best friend I've known for 13 years and after being single for 10 years. I finally am able to accept and feel love. 
It's simply amazing."
"I was looking for someone to say Wellbutrin. 

Literally turned my life around. Was on Zoloft for a long time and just struggled with finding motivation to do anything. Just felt ‚Äústuck‚Äù all the time. Wellbutrin finally gave me the boost I needed to get my butt in gear and establish a routine and just‚Ä¶.do stuff. It finally made me feel like I‚Äôm awake and not just floating through life."
Started Wellbutrin today. ü§ûüèæ hope i have the same results.
"Wellbutrin, along with my other meds, has been amazing for me!

The downside is how much I sweat! Did anyone deal with this issue? I mentioned it to my psych & they said we could try another med but I‚Äôm afraid it won‚Äôt work as well as WB. I don‚Äôt want to mess with it but it‚Äôs getting unbearable."
"I'm on a low dose maintenance amount of Wellbutrin and it really helps. I personally don't feel numb at all, I still have normal emotions. That's the point for me... NORMAL emotions. Not these dramatic swings of deep depression or despair. In retrospect, yes I am prone to depression, but I think I had pretty bad PMDD as well. I feel like a normal functioning person on it.¬†"
"Wellbutrin did nothing for me except make my hair fall out. Fluoxetine (Prozac) kind of works for me in that it stabilizes my moods, but doesn't really give me back my motivation or joy. But it's better than nothing! 

I definitely agree that medication can help though, and that people should try to get past the stigma and stubbornness and just go get it if they think they need it. Just because I haven't found the drug that works for me, doesn't mean you won't have better luck."
"This makes me so happy to read, I just started on it a week ago"
"Hijacking this comment to give an important reminder for people reading through all these psych meds comments:¬†

SOOO important to understand that **NOT EVERY MED WORKS FOR EVERYONE, AND ONE THAT MAY WORK GREAT FOR YOU MAY NOT FOR SOMEONE ELSE, and vice versa!!**¬†

Never EVER let someone else‚Äôs experiences with a med determine your own unique mental health journey and discussions + decisions with your psychiatrist/prescriber.¬†"
"I‚Äôve been on Wellbutrin for 10 years. It‚Äôs stabilized me and the lows have never been as low. Someday I‚Äôd like to see what life is like without it, but I‚Äôm not rushing it. 

+ weekly therapy, exercise, routine"
"I feel this. Meds really ‚Äúturned the static down‚Äù in my brain, so to speak. And just like you I had a ‚ÄúI should have done this years ago,‚Äù reaction. Took me a couple different meds to find one that worked for me (ironically, Wellbutrin made me a hair-triggered a-hole and had to try something else), but once I found one it was like a light switch got thrown. Did not solve ALL my problems, but took a big load off."
"The stigma around using medication when needed for mental health is unreal.


I've watched my buddy wrestle with some big issues¬†a decade plus of his life because it's on the ""I'm not gonna consider it ever"" train"
For real I think Wellbutrin is the only thing keeping me alive. I‚Äôd be asleep for 20 hours a day without it. A blessing for me.
"Wow, didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd see the medication that worked for me so high up. 

Wellbutrin is a game changer. Doesn‚Äôt do it all but it allowed me to stop feeling helpless and start feeling.. energized..? Like I had the motivation to be better suddenly instead of the years of yearning, no action, self pity, hopelessness, numbness, sleep. Repeat until one day I felt normal enough to get out of bed. 

No there are no more days where I don‚Äôt get out of bed from sadness or mental state. Not in 5 years. I ain‚Äôt going back. 

Exercise and not being in college also helped a fuck ton. Oh and i quit my recreational use. Wasn‚Äôt just the Wellbutrin."
"Me too! Late diagnosis at 30!! I'm still pretty burnt out, but I realized most of the time I'm not depressed I'm just exhausted and overstimulated. When I'm well rested, fed, my body temperature is regulated, and I spent some time in silence, I am the most stable person. But make me work multiple days at work in a row, before my period, and I am the most unstable person. Wild, thank you for sharing."
"yes same here! found out i was autistic, realized that what i thought were depression & anxiety were logical reactions to circumstances created by autism, had a whole journey of self-acceptance and went off a LOT of meds."
I've always suspected I'm on the spectrum. Maybe it's why I always feel so burnt out and why the nine antidepressants I've taken don't seem to work.
"What kind of tools did you use? I have a sneaking suspicion. I am on the spectrum, and it could explain why meds didn't work, etc."
"Life is a stressor, and the few people I know who have ""gotten better"" are people who have the luxury of dropping out of the workforce¬†"
"I feel like I was saying, ""I just need to be allowed to do my job,"" for like ten years before I had a job I felt like I could do without being needlessly fucked with. And lo and behold, once I had about three months without any problems, my mental health began to improve."
"Amen to this.  I protect my solo time, and enthusiastically assure everyone that no, I do not need to get out more."
"ADHD here, but this is my new method, too. I take the naps, I avoid the high-stress social situations, I buy the premade foods, and I take my meds. Burnout fucked me *up* and I won‚Äôt go through that again."
"Same, but with ADHD. All of the antidepressants in the world won‚Äôt work if the dopamine is the problem, not the serotonin."
"Same. Pandemic made me realize how exhausting I found being out in the world. Ketamine helped with the depression and burn-out. Had it together for awhile, but dad's hospice knocked things out of whack. Getting them back in order though."
Thank you for this.
"Exactly the same for me. Diagnosed in my 50s, burnout was the cause of my ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù."
"Same. The right diagnoses, now I am managing my limits and the big thing is I forgave myself. I don't think I'm bad anymore. I had a whole magical breakthrough and everything. Wow!"
"None of my counselors/therapists/whatever ever seem to want to acknowledge the autistic part of me. So I'll go in with some blahblahblah problem and after learning about burnout and stuff I'm privately like ""Huh I wonder if that's all it was"" but I don't even bother mentioning it because they won't listen. 

I mean man I got diagnosed in like 2007 and only just *this year* learned about ""autistic burnout"" and it was like a lightbulb going off. Oh THAT'S why sometimes I just can't talk all day! Oh THAT'S why sometimes even though I'm otherwise fine, I'll be having a ""too loud"" day where it's like all my senses are heightened even worse than normal."

What kind of drastic lifestyle changes occurred in East Africa?
Nothing will lift your veil like Africa. Ghana saved my life.
"A change of environnment and relation circle is a great way to deal with it. We are social creatures that need to fit in a community, so when we get ourselves with kind and generous people that support us, we want to belong with them. The first big step is that you wanted to step outside of your depressive world and that's **The** thing that made things work. Moving away is not always the miracle solution, people needs to want the change and work for it as well.

Source : I didn't change country but had the kind of same experience."
What do you think did it? Was it seasonal depressive disorder and just being in a sunny warm place did it? Or did it change your outlook?
"‚ÄúDecent friends‚Äù -this part is very important.

 I faced 4 suicide attempts and I‚Äôve always wondered why I‚Äôm still here and why others didn‚Äôt make it. That‚Äôs until I took a look around. Your support group is so freakin important. So I always advise people to never be afraid to cut off people, even family. But also **value** the ones keeping you alive."
"Yes hi, I would like to see your depression curing cat please."
"Same here - I had a friend that basically sucked the life out of me - multiple people, in fact. The process of being all alone and then having to basically learn how to live with yourself is definitely the scariest part lol. But eventually I somehow managed to find new acquaintances and pull through, \*somehow\*. To this day I have no idea how I managed to do it."
"As a fellow depression sufferer, I heard a psychologist say, ‚Äúbefore diagnosing depression, I like to find out if the patient is surrounded by assholes.‚Äù  That just clicked with me.   Don‚Äôt hangout with assholes. Check."
"This except replace toxic people with ""my parents"" lmao"
"I got divorced. About 6 months later, I realized that for the first time in my life, I wasn't depressed."
Yeah it was everyone else that made me depressed...once the world around me got better I was fine.  I didn't even have to work on myself!
I heard a therapist say that they check to see if you are really depressed or just surrounded by assholes
"Whenever I do this, I feel that I just sort of give in to them‚Ä¶ and they I sink with them. I‚Äôm not sure how to acknowledge my negative feelings and do something productive with it."
"Yes! Mushrooms have changed my life. I‚Äôm a combat veteran, with the subsequent issues that come with that. Went to years of therapy, the VA prescribed me 26 prescriptions, but boy oh boy did mushrooms do the trick for me. PSA, I am not advocating everyone try this, do your research first and don‚Äôt ditch your current meds without consulting a doctor. I decided to take a healthy dose in a place I feel comfortable, camping in the desert. I set my intentions prior to the experience of wanting to develop better mental health. I also insisted to not fight it (this is very important), just let the journey take you where it takes you, open every door, walk down every hallway. I also had my wife watching over me as a ‚Äúbabysitter‚Äù. It‚Äôs incredible to say the least. It‚Äôs not a cure all, but it was a night/day difference. Old habits start coming back in here and there and a maintaining micro dose tends to take care of those and if it starts getting bad, its journey time again. Word of advice, have a toilet nearby, they will clear you out."
"Yep. Mushrooms took me from being depressed and actively suicidal every single day of my life since I was a teen- with a couple attempts - to no depression at all. I'd been in decades of therapy, done TMS (got 6 months free of depression from that), and 60+ prescriptions over the years. Mushrooms fixed my brain and it's crazy to be mentally healthy."
"How did you manage to get into that headspace? Back in 2020, I did psychedelics fairly regularly and I was probably the happiest I‚Äôve ever been (not incredibly happy, mind you, but happy). I stopped for a couple of years, and depression sort of started happening again but I used cannabis to help get through it. Then I started a job last year and I can‚Äôt use cannabis anymore, so I started drinking. Not a good idea, I know, but it was my only option from my point of view then. Then my wife found a way to get some mushrooms, and I‚Äôve taken them a few times but they don‚Äôt seem to be helping in the same way they did last time. Sorry if that‚Äôs a lot."
"Mushrooms showed me during my first ever trip that I can be grateful for the simple fact of existence.

Showing me I don't need to eat, get gifts or be loved in order to be happy.
It's a state I can exist within.

Changed my whole outlook on life, I take my happiness very personally now and work hard to maintain it."
For me it was a 1g dose. Was a reset moment and am in a much better place since
I‚Äôm tryna do that with a friend of mine but it‚Äôs not working. Idk what to do
"People vastly underestimate exercise. You are an entire body, not just a brain.¬†"
"Lmaooo I appreciate this honesty. I have a friend who took a heroic dose of shrooms and her bulimia disappeared. (I know you might be talking about different drugs, but yeah‚Ä¶)"
"Haha, yup. For me antidepressants helped a good amount but anxiety still killed me. My first time doing shrooms took like half of that away. Three years of daily drug abuse later, I‚Äôm like weirdly overjoyed to be alive. Sometimes I‚Äôm like ‚ÄòMan I wanna die‚Äô but it‚Äôs still under the preset of ‚ÄòBeing alive as a human is the luckiest thing ever why aren‚Äôt people having more fun???‚Äô"
"Yeah, same here. For some of us it‚Äôs as simple as that‚Äî chemical imbalance.

But I think what a lot of people get wrong is that these meds don‚Äôt just turn you happy‚Äî they‚Äôre not a ‚Äòcheat code‚Äô. They give you the energy and desire to actually improve your life and feel better again, which was one of the most glorious feelings ever."
"Sertraline and Abilify saved me for real. I was having regular serious suicidal thoughts for a long time. I haven‚Äôt felt that way sense I‚Äôve started taking the Abilify in combination with Sertraline. I finally feel balanced. I still have strong emotions, but I‚Äôm able to regulate them and I don‚Äôt go to the extremes anymore."
"These were an incredible fix for me when I was depressed 

But

They triggered the first bi polar episode of my wife's life, and she moved out on me and my kid and close to ruined her life.

Please tell your doctor if anyone in your family has a history of bi-polar when discussing taking SSRIs."
Same!

"Ketamine therapy changed my husband's life, and by association, my own, as well."

Ooh it was hormones for me too. Turns out too much oestrogen makes you as mad as a bag of cats
"Can you imagine a therapist recommending that? ‚ÄúWell, all you have to do is realize you‚Äôre a spineless coward and then your problems will be over.‚Äù

For the record, I am VERY glad that your normal, healthy reticence about killing yourself won out in the end."
[deleted]
Very logical approach.  I like it.
Omega 3's and creatine work wonders for my depression.
Vit D and an iron tablet for my anemia help me keep the depression from turning into severe suicidal ideation. I just tell my husband I‚Äôm a vampire that can‚Äôt get sunshine or healthy blood the normal way.¬†
Psilocybin has worked wonders for me
"That sounds neat, but I don't even know where to buy shrooms. Like, do people know a guy? I'm in Brazil and I don't even know if it's legal here, but it sounds amazing"
"I‚Äôd taken them here and there for a few years, generally successfully, then finally committed myself to the idea of doing a medium to high dose every 2 weeks until something changed. Eventually, some chronically tight muscles finally relaxed, and with it came posture improvements, and huge huge pain relief. Soon after I had a day where I didn‚Äôt have a depressed thought or physical pain all day, the first full day in years.

Something something neuroplasticity, maladaptive default mode network, vascularization"
"Had a friend on a journey with us who had a very bad trip. In attempting to calm him down and demonstrate ease, I started to try and guide him through meditation. I let my body relax and melt into the floor, controlled my breathing, focused on a single point in space, and wholly unintentionally became one with the spiritual center of the universe. Really I was just trying to calm down my friend, but I was no longer myself, but a shimmering ball of bright light, and everytime I exhaled, all the dust of petty human attachments and anxieties fell off like gently drifting snow. As each breath left my body, the orb that was me became brighter and more calm. It is the most tranquil peace I have ever felt. It was like for that moment, time was meaningless. All of my senses blended into one magnificent sensation which I can only describe as that brief instant when you hear the chime of the most calming beautiful bell you've ever heard, only that one instant is stretched for eternity in every dimension and aspect, smoothing out the turbulent ripples of the ocean leaving a sheet of pure reflective glass. 

About a month later I went on to summon the motivation to throw everything I had at my depression, diet, exercise, regular sleep, no intoxicants, regular therapy. I lost 35 pounds and finished writing a novel. 

Then a year or so in, found a new job, added a buttload of new stress, and became more depressed than ever. What I learned was it's not a cure-all, you still have to work or depression will creep in. So back to therapy I go."

These really do work.
"Same. After our son lost his battle, we gave magnets out that say, 

‚ÄúWe all have battles we are fighting. Be kind to yourself. Be kind to others‚Äù. 

Reading through all of these posts makes it clear, there are so many others fighting their battles.  Sending as many good vibes to everyone as I can."
"My mum had this too, she has had depression for years and had to be institutionalised about three times in her life. 

A few months ago when she was last hospitalised they deemed her a candidate for TMS and she underwent about 13 bouts of it. It has worked absolute wonders for her and she has improved so much. After years of different drugs and therapy it‚Äôs amazing to see. 

However, I think it‚Äôs a lot less common because it‚Äôs expensive and only considered for patients who have exhausted all other options medically."
I would like to try this. Hoping my insurance will cover some of it.
"Here for this. Yes! TMS -transcranial magnetic stimulation- non invasive, targeted. I was quickly heading for ECT-electro-convulsive therapy (yeah, shock therapy is still a thing).  But a doctor willing to work to get my insurance company to pay for treatment-still had to pay-A LOT out of pocket, but I‚Äôm here."
"TMS and Vyvanse. Absolute game-changer.

Its insane. Something like a 60% efficacy rate? That blows any antidepressant so far out of the water its not even funny. 

And hey, maybe its all placebo. But if it works ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
"same! micro dosing changed everything, so drastically that i stopped therapy after the second dose.  
0.1g per dose (dry mushrooms) every 3 days, 10 doses, no alcohol during the whole month.  
depression gone by 2/3 after the first dose, two days of pause in between, then completely gone after the second.  
i'm over a month after the end of the whole protocol and my mood is still stable af, i just can't believe it after decades of this f' virus.  
cheap, no side effects, effective af - can only recommend! :-)

ps: browse the national library of medicine's website, the one that gathers so many studies, and type ""psilocybin"" on it, it's absolutely incredible how many benefits have been found not only for depression, but also anxiety, ocd, adhd... they even study the possible effect for delaying dementia... this it just incredible and very annoying that this isn't legal in the vast majority of countries of this world, when we know that anti-depressants don't cure shit, they only numb us, have plenty of terrible side effects, and subscribe you for months/years to them. such a shame..."

"High dose exercise has been the most effective antidepressant for me. Meds helped pull me out of the hole, but I need a minimum of 2 hours of daily exercise to stay antidepressed. Going above that works even better, up to 4 hours daily.¬†


It sounds like a lot, but my typical day is an hour of walking the dog and 1-2 hour long dance classes. Or an hour dog walk + 90 minute weight lifting/stretching session"
"Like antidepressants, dogs do not work for everyone. I LOVE my dog, but if I didnt have my partner to help take care of her things would get very bad very fast. Yes, 80% of the time her presence and having to take care of her keeps me sane, but in the 20% severe depression spirals I CANNOT handle her. When the worst case scenario hits (I'm in a bad depression and my partner is gone for 2 days for work) it is so hard. I force myself to do what I have to, but I feel worse and worse until eventually I resent my dog and then hate myself for resenting my dog and end up sobbing on our walk. Do not reccomend."
Runners high is better than any SSRI
"I never realized my dad was depressed with my mom until a few years after their divorce, he was constantly doing things with his kids, wanting to chat, going out and socializing, being productive, buying what he wanted. Man, I‚Äôm gonna tear up‚Äî I can‚Äôt imagine what the 20+ years of depression did to him, and I‚Äôm so happy to see it over."
I‚Äôm doing this through Yale Monday. I‚Äôm scared but hopeful.
"Oddly enough, I understand you!"
"Good work, Minecraft Steve."
"I'm 43, my kid is 9. How can't you lose your shit thinking about your children's future?  Even if they're grown, they'll want children.  And even if they don't, im certain we all have war, famine and extreme weather on our doorsteps.  How doesn't that make you worried out of your mind? I don't know how to teach mine how to survive this future pain free.  It is making me insane."
"I searched ""Voyeurs View"" on DuckDuckGo to confirm if it was a reference to something and I ended up just finding a lot of porn instead"
"My grandma, who's 90, has always been a ball of anxiety her entire life. When I call her I need to carefully navigate what topics we talk about. Generally sticking to the weather and how the kids are doing in school and normal day to day goings-on. If I mention any trips, she frets about things that could go wrong. If I mention anything that needs to be fixed around the house, she frets that its going to break and hurt someone. If I talk about money, she frets that none of us have enough. And it gets bad enough that she'll call my dad and spend hours on the phone worrying. So I try to save him from that."
"Losing my family in the span of 7 years did it for me. Lost both parents, my siblings both went mad. I‚Äôm like Lemony Snicket."

"Yeah this is super important. 

When I was young, I had it, got through it, and ""didn't"" have it. 

Then when it came back, I was surprised and frustrated. Then I got through it again 

Then that happened again. And again. And again, over the course of decades, before I finally realized that it's a cycle. 

Or it's maintenance, like brushing your teeth. Or a better metaphor is like dealing with a cold. It happens, it sucks. But you learn to live with it while it's happening, and enjoy the times it's not.

Lifestyle changes really do help to get you out of The Pit. Counseling helps you get tools to notice when you're slipping, prevent or slow the slipping, and deal with it when you do. And it'll happen. And it's ok."
So‚Ä¶. When does it go?
That's true. Having a depressive personality is kinda permanent. You just learn to manage it. I had a good few years until recently but there's no ways I'd assume I've become a completely different person than I was. The 'voices' return when triggered by certain life events (or sometimes nothing at all)
"I dealt with it my entire life. Tried counseling, medication, diet, and exercise. Honestly, I was ready to give up. My cats kept that from happening. Once I hit forty, I was just so over being depressed. I had just gotten out of a bad relationship in which there were control issues. After the breakup and taking back control, I also decided I wasn't going to let my depression control me anymore. It wasn't easy, and I know this would not work for everyone. I just made the decision to take back my brain. Fuck you depression, only I get to decide how I feel. I still have bouts, but I just force myself to do a mental reset. 

Basically, I just wasn't going to let D control me anymore."
"There are different types of depression, which is among the reasons it can be so hard to understand. Some people have ""episodes"" and then get better (episodes can last days or even years). Others of us are fucked for life - or until we find the right meds (which has to happen time and time again as we grow and change). The first type sounds like a fairy tale to me, but suicide runs in my family, so yeah.. Sounds like you too are a lifer. Sorry."
Tried TMS or ketamine or it‚Äôs easier to get brother esketamine?
"Exactly, mine has stayed put going on 14 years now. There's no ""going"", just staying. Doesn't help that horrible things keep happening to me. This past year I had to quit my job to care for my father, now my father died and I'm emotionally exhausted and broke. Not to mention similar stuff that happened since I was a child. Sometimes I wonder if my depression is chemical related or just a normal consequence of being life's punching bag."

So my bank account has essentially never dipped below 4 figures (there was a one time snafu with a double withdrawal but other than that, never).

"Ive unfortunately found myself on the stability treadmill.¬†

I‚Äôve been chasing the feeling of stability after growing up very poor, and I‚Äôve keep thinking that hitting the next financial milestone would finally allow me to let off the gas a bit and feel vaguely secure.¬†

But even with six digits (and closer to 7 digits than to 5) to my name, I still can‚Äôt shake the feeling of incoming destitution. Every random $200 unexpected expense still sends me into a minor panic attack, or fills me with anger at whatever failed that caused that expense.¬†

I have a friend who says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all a part of it‚Äù and I‚Äôve adopted it as well.
My favorite is ‚Äúthe sun will rise and we will try again‚Äù especially when I find the day has gone by and I didn‚Äôt do anything.
"Think of it in pieces. Whenever I can‚Äôt do anything, the first step is to get out of bed. I literally sit directly next to my bed on the floor and take a minute. Then when I feel ready I just walk to the bathroom and sit on the floor in there. And then when I‚Äôm ready I take my clothes off and keep sitting. Eventually I get cold and end up turning the shower on. It takes forever but it‚Äôs better than doing nothing."
"Start incredibly small, with just drinking water in the morning. Leave a glass of water by your bedside the night before to make it easier. Just drink water when you wake up every morning for 5 days in a row, that‚Äôs all you have to do. That‚Äôs week 1. If that works, and it feels good, maybe add another thing for week 2, like going to the grocery store to get some healthy breakfast stuff. Maybe have a cup of yogurt with granola in it, or a piece of fruit and an egg for breakfast. Make a few hard boiled eggs at a time, so you have part of a ready-made breakfast already. Do that 3 times in a row, and know that 5 days in a row may be too much for you to commit to and thats okay. See how it feels to do 3 days. Maybe have a little ritual when you get home from work, like reading one poem from a book you leave next to the chair you usually watch TV in. Or meditating for 5 minutes. 
I‚Äôve found the trick is to set very small goals, and set your environment up for good habits when you‚Äôre even a little motivated, so that when you aren‚Äôt motivated, like first thing in the morning or right after work, it‚Äôs just that much easier to say yes to the thing you know will give your soul a little boost and is good for you. 
Doing this, in 3 months I went from having no healthy habits at all, to making my bed every morning, eating healthy breakfast every morning, and WORKING OUT which is something I had NEVER done in my 40 years on earth. It doesn‚Äôt work every single day. Some days I‚Äôm hungover and feel shitty about myself and don‚Äôt make mentally healthy choices. But the vast majority of days I do, and it started with tiny habits. 
I know it‚Äôs really hard. Hope you find something that works for you!"
"I personally got a gym membership and have been sticking to it for 4 months now.¬† Great place to blast music, get cardio, and decompress emotions.¬† Evenimg walks during sunset has brought me a lot of peace too.¬† Before this I was playing video games or scrolling reddit.¬† I can do both now, but with the bonus of being healthier."
I adopted a dog that needs a lot of walking. He changed my life for the better in so many ways. I have to take him out even if I don‚Äôt feel like it. I‚Äôve had him for 4 years now and I look and feel so much better. He‚Äôs an asshole but I love that lil guy and our walks together.
"Be kind to yourself and be okay with beginning again. I‚Äôve struggled a long time with all or nothing thinking, for instance if I‚Äôm trying to eat healthy and have one ‚Äúbad‚Äù meal I‚Äôll just throw up my hands and not even try for days or weeks after. But lately I‚Äôve been trying to recognize the patterns that lead to me struggling, and accepting that some days are harder than others, but I can start again the next day."
"I think it's very hard to make yourself do anything with severe depression.  It's not a lack of ""will power"", you are literally ill.  That isn't to say you can't start a routine or develop new habits, but I think too many people feel shame about not being able to function.  It's not a personality flaw."
"What worked for me was to keep doing things, even if incompletely, and try to prepare what I could to improve the next day. Even when I'm well, I try to discipline myself to get things ready for the next day, because I never know how I'm going to wake up.

For example, I try to exercise for an hour every day. Sometimes it's only 30 minutes and sometimes all I can do is get to the front door. Or maybe I can't even change my clothes to go to the gym, but if I can choose my clothes so that I don't have to do this extra task tomorrow, that's fine too."
"This was huge for me.
Daily routine and the discipline to do it takes a good 85% of depression and anxiety out of my life. 

When you don‚Äôt feel like it, which is just ‚Äúmind chatter‚Äùbecause it‚Äôs as easy to NOT do something as it to DO something‚Ä¶ 

Ask yourself this ‚ÄúWill I feel beater or worse if I don‚Äôt keep my routine?‚Äù
Go from there. You never ‚Äúhave to do anything‚Äù ever. 
But choosing to do something, is a great feeling and sense of accomplishment, and boosts your mood. 
So‚Ä¶.. Choose wisely.

Start small‚Ä¶ like always making your bed‚Ä¶. Or walking outside for 15m, and keep the one thing for a week, at the same time daily. 
See how you feel after a week. 
Then add other things, while keeping the bed making or walking outside. 
Build on it, so bigger tasks don‚Äôt feel so overwhelming. 

It gets easier and you feel better with each task you add and keep up with."
Discipline. Thats all it is really. Not doing your routine otherwise is just making excuses. Sometimes you have to do things when you aren‚Äôt feeling it. Just go through the motions. It helps.
"My advice is find something that brings you a lot of joy and add that to your routine, or little things that you enjoy and add it into the mundane. It can be simple. 

Example: I love skincare, it is my favorite part of the day. It makes me feel good and I find it fun. I start and end my day that way and it adds a whole lot of structure to my day. If that's not something you like, I think it still makes you feel better and starts the day on the right foot, so add something to it that you enjoy. Listen to a podcast, read/listen to your favorite book/song, make yourself a cup of tea to help you wind down in the evening, or make your coffee/morning treat. Anything to make it feel like a special part of your day that you are taking care of you. 


It will give you something to look forward to each day, first and last thing. That's what helped me get into and keep a routine."
"I think I'm starting to realize that this might be what I need to really pull myself up out of my rut as well. I spend far too much time in my fuckin head trying to... I really don't even know honestly. To predict the future? (anxiety) Rewrite/relive the past? (regret & rumination)

I try and stave these things off by frittering away time on this and - entertainment, social media, etc. but it really does not fill you with the feeling of being in the same way frittering away time in the company of other people does, the same way making something with your own two hands does, the same way immersing yourself in nature does.

It's good to enjoy your own company and be self sufficient, but we weren't meant to be so deeply immersed in our own heads. Thoughtful reflections and trying to understand who and why you are is an incredibly healthy thing, but I feel that too many of us do this to an obsessive extent - consciously or not.

Just about the only way for me to exit my head and stave off the overthinking spiral of thoughts is to keep busy. Keep busy and try to make as many mistakes as possible. I'm never going to learn how not to fail by staying inside - my head, my room, or any other comfort zone.

The more you try, the more you'll realize that messing up and not having it figured out is actually the best way to move forward. You learn, you grow, you laugh at yourself, you make memories, and build confidence that you'll figure it out. Make it to the next day, the next month, next year - with a lot of goodness found along the way."
Try going on walk or working using podcasts. Only aim for positive ones (so experts quietly discussing their topics or gentle motivational voices. It's the kind of voices you want in your head)
I had settled on Prozac even though it made me feel like a zombie. It was the only one that even helped at all. I wanted to try Wellbutrin for ages but no one would prescribe it to me because I struggled with alcohol abuse. Finally I found a psychiatrist willing to let me try it and I literally feel cured of depression. I‚Äôm a different person on Wellbutrin.
"I've been on Wellbutrin (and other things) for almost 15 years now, still working consistently so far!"
"Don‚Äôt get discouraged. You can add other pills if it stops ‚Äòworking‚Äô. 
I‚Äôm on Wellbutrin & lexapro. 
The trial & error period sucks so much.
So many tears."
"This is very much my experience as well. 
I had such high hopes for wellbutrin and when they started to take effect I didn't like how robotic and numb I felt."
"wellbutrin was the first antidepressant that truly gave me hope. i‚Äôve been taking prozac instead for years and it is INCREDIBLE (for me), but i will always be grateful for wellbutrin."
"I weaned off Zoloft this week and every single thing, sad or happy, brings me to tears!"
This is what Prozac did to me.  Just felt flat as fuck.
Started at 150. Stayed with that for a few yrs. then went to 300. Bumped up to 450. Realized I was numb and not functioning well. Dropped myself back to 300. Much better dosage for me.
Same. I'm glad you're here with us still :)
"I know what you mean.


For me, Wellbutrin silences the suicidal ""voices"" that would never go away that have been there since I was a little kid.¬†"
"It did work on me, but it made my insomnia worse. I was awake for 72 hours straight. 600 mg of seroquel and nortriptyline was the thing that fixed me. Also, a bit of weed here and there."
Isn't it heart breaking to get releif and learn that you're broken and everyone has been way happier than you the whole time
"I don't have any side effects, I'm 38 and also dropped from 64kg to 57kg, but I have been stable on 60 for the last few months."
"Just so you know, for some people the adjustment period can make you very angry before it helps. when i started it i was raging and irrationally mad at absolutely nothing and everyone until i balanced out. Remember to try to not lash out at loved ones if this happens to you also.."
I‚Äôm starting tomorrow! Best of luck for both of us!
"Idk how I never put that together! I use to never sweat,& then I would wake up drenched in sweat! It's soo gross,but I guess if that's my only side effect, it's worth it!"
"Omg, the sweating. I‚Äôm dripping all the time now in summer. But Wellbutrin brought back the color to the world, the motivations for my day, and I no longer trudge through life just existing. But holy cow I wouldn‚Äôt mind sweating less!"
I started getting night sweats after upping my dose a couple years back. It sucks but I just look at it as a trade-off because I'd sooner wake up sweaty than feel as I felt before starting my meds.
Yes!! I mentioned it to my psych and he was doubtful that it was from the meds. I feel so validated‚ÄîI knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy üôÉ
I forgot about the heat! I was definitely running hot for a while after I started but that‚Äôs resolved.
"My wife was on Wellbutrin for years. It seems that after those years it started causing her to have shakes. But she didn't know it was coming from the Wellbutrin. She went to see a neurologist for a diagnosis, maybe Parkinson's?  They ended up taking away her driver's license. About a year later a psych doctor changed her medications for unrelated reasons and removed the Wellbutrin The shakes went away. She has not gotten her license back, though. Of course, this is not saying others will have this experience."
"I feel this same way. I have such a difficult time working more than three days in a row. Like my mental state just goes to shit because of it. I hate it. I've tried so many antidepressants and none of them seem to help. I'd try to get diagnosed, but I'm not sure how knowing for sure would help with anything."
"Thank you for sharing as well! I relate so much with the burnt out feeling but when I really break it down, I‚Äôm either really exhausted or overstimulated as you have described. Never considered this. Sometimes Reddit is truly a wonderful place."
"""what i thought were depression & anxiety were logical reactions to circumstances created by autism""

"https://embrace-autism.com/autism-tests/ is a great resource. Specifically their RAADS-R and CAT-Q tests. These tests are used in official diagnostic screenings, and while they aren‚Äôt foolproof/a formal diagnosis in of themselves, they can help you get a clearer picture of how you may land on the spectrum"
"yeah, part of my getting better was a job change too. i stopped having meltdowns and panic attacks at work when i switched to a job of just cutting fruit. it was essentially hiding in a back room and chopping all day, very therapeutic. it‚Äôs the only way i was able to maintain a full time job. there are roles that are minimally stressful, they‚Äôre just hard to find 

my dad is also autistic and hasn‚Äôt worked in 30 years despite being just as intelligent as anybody. that doesn‚Äôt matter. working is just way too stressful for him"
"I am by no means telling which medication works or doesn't work for you, nor making suggestion on how to, or whether, to medicate. However, the serotonin hypothesis is falling apart right now. The meds still work, but the meds are developed by throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks, rather than the hyper specific research most people think that goes into it. That is not to minimize the science, or drugs themselves. Also, the body is highly complex, and neurotransmitters needs to be in goldilocks zone, not too much, not too little, so it is again all sorts of complicated. Plus Wellbutrin is advertised to  affect dopamine and not serotonin. 

I am only saying this to prevent people from thinking well, I am neurodivergent, so it wont work for me. That's not true for a lot of people. ANd for a lot of people ADHD stimulants will not work, but antidepressants will. And for a lot of people neither seem to work. I highly urge to work with a competent psychiatrist if possible, and also figuring out support routines and accommodations that work.

"I'm not the commentor you asked, but for me, getting into dance (ballet and pole dancing) has changed my life.  I was already active with distance running and lifting, so not the exercise,  it's more the community and the finding joy and excitement learning something new.  I'm an adult beginner so I'm terrible but I absolutely love the process."

"You couldnt be more accurate about trajectory. And anyone else reading, im 170 lbs, 6 foot, exercise every day. My sleep doc said he wouldnt have guessed I had sleep apnea in a million years until he measured my neck and looked at my airway. I think its a fairly under diagnosed medical condition that would change the lives of so many people."
"Yeah I did the same (searching for CPAP)

For me it was like a magic depression switch, within a few months it completely vanished after decades of suffering.

Who knew getting half an hour of sleep at night for 20+ years caused issues?"
Lean build. Virtually no fat on me. I definitely snore lying flat. I sleep amazing with or without it but it got to the point where i physically could not stay awake for a full day. Napping at least an hour every day. I can only bet that this had been an issue when I was really young too. I figured everyone was able to stay awake because everyone drank coffee and i didnt (still dont). No need for it at all now.

"You did it because you decided to!! Give yourself credit. 
The toxic people you had, are gone. You made the changes. Good for you fellow Redditor. 
It‚Äôs not easy, but you did it."
"I would let go of the idea that you need to do something productive with them. You don‚Äôt. Just let them be there.

You have to practice observing the emotions, allowing them to exist, accepting their presence WITHOUT being dragged under by them.

And how do you do that? It‚Äôs definitely something mindfulness can help with. Observing the emotion allows you to focus on its existence without being dragged down the rabbit hole. Tara Brach has an acronym called RAIN that is super useful here:

Recognize - notice what you‚Äôre feeling. Name it. Anger, rage, fear, hopelessness, whatever. 

Allow - allow it to be there, don‚Äôt fight it‚Äôs existence. I like to say ‚Äúthis too‚Äù as in ‚Äúall of my emotions are welcome here, this one too‚Äù

Investigate - notice where you feel it in your body, how it shows up in your body, how strong it is, etc. notice if it‚Äôs masking something else (for example, often anger is masking an underlying fear - don‚Äôt get bogged down in that fear, just notice it and move on). 

Nurture - give yourself a hug, a literal hug. Be compassionate to yourself. I try to picture myself as a small child (or a puppy works here, some people don‚Äôt resonate with an inner child), what would I say to that child if they were experiencing what I am? This is the most important step for me. Just be fucking nice to yourself for a few minutes.

Listen to Tara Brachs podcasts for a better explanation."
Love this! It doesn‚Äôt fix everything but it sure comes close for lots of people. I was on anti depressants and hated it. Couldn‚Äôt function. The mushrooms ended the need for any medication and haven‚Äôt ever even thought of it since that first dose. It did what it needed to really quickly for me.
I hope you get an answer from someone who can help you. You already know that alcohol is the worst replacement . Wishing you better days ahead.
"Honestly, mental state is everything. If you go into it expecting to be happy, but you‚Äôre stressed and depressed, you likely won‚Äôt get to that happy place the same way you used to. You have to go into it with an open mind, and in a calm, comfortable mental state. My favourite happy/relaxed music helps me too"
"Last time I took mushrooms, the mushrooms told me I wasn't getting another trip until I took meditation seriously. After doing that, I just never really got around to using mushrooms again. ü§£ So have you tried that?

Not all meditation techniques work for everyone, and it has its own pros and cons (the dark night can fuck you up), but there are books for trauma-sensitive and ADHD approaches and stuff now."
"It's a difficult spot to be in. But make sure you let them know that you're there. Or if you are good friends then suggest low-stress activities. ""Let's stay home order in and watch a movie together?"". If they're not responding or ghosting then take care of your own mental health too."

"Yup! Meds can only take you so far, but that might be far enough to allow you to do the work you couldn't before. It can be very hard (if not impossible) to change your habits, be healthier, work out etc when you can't even get the motivation to get out of bed. It's hard to feel motivated to work on yourself and improve if you don't even want to wake up tomorrow. But medication without self care and effort will only push the issue instead of solving it."
"Prob not a misdiagnosis but depression can be a symptom of adhd when it runs unchecked. ¬†

In my opinion adhd is incredibly misunderstood and misrepresented on social media. It‚Äôs a very deep and complex disorder."
[deleted]
"It's typically not a misdiagnosis, it's a dual diagnosis. The depression can be caused by the stress of trying to operate in the world with undiagnosed ADHD. When you keep failing over and over it is literally a depressing experience. The depression is real, but treating the ADHD symptoms can resolve the stressors that trigger depressive episodes."
"I don't know if it's changed by now, but from 80s-00s ADHD was considered a boy's issue. So many, many girls were untreated or their symptoms were attributed to hormones.¬†


If they were treated for mental health, most of the time they were diagnosed with depression, which fed more into the model of female = depressed.¬†


Of course, this was not the case for all. But many people who were able to get treatment for ADHD after years of unsuccessful treatment for depression.¬†


For adults, it is known ADHD has co-morbidities with other mental health issues, there is newer research into how entangled they are. As in, is the person depressed because of poor treatment outcomes or actual brain chemical imbalance or did the poor treatment outcome cause the chemical imbalance.¬†


Ologies by Allie Ward has a fantastic series on ADHD. cannot recommend enough. https://www.alieward.com/ologies/adhd


For my anecdotal evidence- I was one of the ones treated for depression my entire life but it never seemed to work. It wasn't until my oldest child was going through their ADHD diagnosis, some core memories were unlocked.¬†


In the 90s I was¬†sitting across from my psychiatrist in conference with my parents as they explained to my parents that they believed I had ADD and put some paperwork on the table to discuss the evidence. My mother pushed the paperwork back towards the psychiatrist said ""no thank you"" grabbed her things and we left. I forgot about this completely because I never saw that psychiatrist again.¬†


Off and on throughout my life I sought mental health treatment because I just felt off. I was always told it was depression and got a diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder, but after a decade of playing around with different meds and nothing ever working, I just gave up, assumed I was just melancholic and would have to deal.¬†


Fast forward back to my 12 yr olds ADHD process. I'm discussing it with my mother and she says ""oh, maybe it's hereditary because remember the quack we took you to tried to tell us that's what your behavioral issues were?"" The reason we left was because the only option (in my parents minds and it was the early 90s) was medication and they already knew they weren't going to medicate me so there was no point in continuing.¬†


I discussed all of this with my GP doc and asked if I could start ADHD treatment. I had returned to school and coping mechanisms I relied on were not working and I was basically drowning between work, family, and grad school.¬†


My first dose of adderall was life changing. I cried and asked my doctor ""is this how normal people work all the time? "" All of my underlying anxiety went away. My thoughts were not racing. I could pick one out, follow it to completion and then pick another one out. I had memory recall. My brain was no longer exhausted all.the.time. I could finally sleep!



Anyway. I share this wall of words in hope that someone who has had no luck in treating their issues gains motivation to keep trying. No matter age, gender, status, everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their brainspace."

"I absolutely subscribe to the idea that the neuroplasticity of psilocybin combined with the focus of meditation is the real kicker. 

Deep in that meditation, I felt muscle groups I didn't even know existed relax. Tension that'd been sitting on my face for decades let up."
"The requirements are getting lessened. I think at this point you only have to have tried 2 antidepressants that didn‚Äôt work, to qualify. That‚Äôs fantastic about your mom!  TMS has been life saving/altering for so many people. Way higher success rate than antidepressants, but again, people don‚Äôt know about it."
Don‚Äôt hold your breath.  TMS was a life changer for me. But it caused its own depression when I had to pay the 16k bill.
"Well the good news is, its never going to be pain free so go ahead and release yourself from that burden. Teach them about finances, saving money and how to be an independent/respectful person. 

Thats all you can do my man. Life is a dice roll. Give them the tools and hope for good rng.

"I would say my anxiety ruined more friendships and relationships around me. The depression is just me taking myself down. With the anxiety I was taking everyone down with me. 

With the anxiety I constantly thought I was dying, I was terrified to do anything, etc. Depression is hell, but it‚Äôs mainly me just isolating and crying all day. Idk if any of this makes sense, lol.

Edit: Oh, meds and therapy helped the anxiety as well. Almost magically. The depression I am still lost on.

2nd Edit: I definitely still have GAD, it‚Äôs just managed OK right now! I don‚Äôt want anyone to think the meds were just a cure or anything. But a huge lifesaver nonetheless! Anxiety is my ride or die tho, depression just has sharper nails right now. üòÇ"
"I get it in reverse, same with Anxiety. In a crisis situation I'm calm and fluid, moving from task to task.
When everything is fine and I'm safe and there is no problem to solve, it all hits like puking or taking a big emotional dump.
The depression and malaise set in when things are going well, it's massively disconcerting."
"I've been able to mostly keep the cycles shallow enough that I can deal with them and not have it be visible. Wasn't always like that, but for the past 20 years or so I've considered myself ""not clinically depressed"" which is a victory.¬†"
What lifestyle changes?
"This exactly. I recently realized it was a cycle and that realization made me finally feel free. Now when it hits me it doesn't feel as disabling, I can at least take care of my dogs and keep my place clean."
"All of what you said is 100% spot on. I've got major depressive disorder,. so I've got a bit to add to it. I've had it for 28 years. It means I will be on anti-depressants and in counseling for the rest of my life because I will never not be depressed. It's just a matter of how depressed I am at any given time. 

Because I have lost two people I love to suic\*de, I know I cannot put my loved ones through it. I won't. The first time was a family friend. He was like a favorite uncle to me and my childhood would have been so much more grim without him. It took me a few years to crawl back from that one. The second loss was my baby brother. That one destroyed me. It took me about eight years to climb out of that hell. I cannot put my loved ones through that experience, especially since I've already been through it at their side, twice.

So that means I get the sleep I need, I make myself get up off my ass and interact with people. I engage in basic self care, though what qualifies as ""basic"" can be pretty scary at times, and most important of all, I ask for help when I need it. That means making an emergency counseling appointment and having my counselor help me decide if I need to make an emergency cal to the person who handles my psych meds. My other health issues makes exercise a joke, but I do what I can. That may just be putting on some MoTown and shimmying my shoulders a little to some Stevie Wonder, or actually going for a walk if my body will cooperate. It can be putting on a movie that will make me laugh, or cracking open a favorite book.

In the United States, there is a suicide and depression hotline, 988. You just call or text it and someone is on the other end who will talk with you."
People like to hate on Twenty One Pilots but their song 'Oldies Station' on their new album describes this feeling in a way that really resonated with me. Totally agree with what you said. Knowing it comes and goes makes it so much easier to handle.
"When you make lifestyle changes and have counselling you start to understand more about depression and what causes it for you, and only then will it ebb and flow, come and go, and you realise that it's not something insurmountable and there is another side always waiting.

Unfortunately it's independent of every person going through it, and they have to work to understand their own depression drivers.

Lifestyle changes = help you find enjoyment in life again 

Counselling = gives you an outlet to discuss and explore what's going on in your life. You'll have little lightbulb moments when you talk about the most mundane shit that helps you identify things you can work on"
I‚Äôm glad I never got that bad to the point medication didn‚Äôt work. My animals were the only reason I didn‚Äôt kill myself until I was able to get a prescription.
"We are all in this together right?! Ugh
Thank you for making the difference
Clear.
Sometimes people go through depression, and sometimes that shit is just permanent. 20 years for
Me and I‚Äôve tried all medicines, therapies, group and 1:1‚Ä¶I‚Äôve tried all that I can and it gets so tiring sometimes. I am looking through this thread taking notes from you fine people. All I can say is that you‚Äôre not suffering alone."
"TBH even cyclic depression is ""for life"". The moment you realize your out of an episode, it dawns on you that the next one is just around the corner."
"So timely to come across this thread, I was literally going to post the same q as op because I wanted to hear similar stories to mine and hope to hear about a positive result, but with the brain fog I just kept forgetting. 

But yeah, all of this. For some people it's a lifelong battle. I've been depressed and suicidal since childhood, been in and out of therapy and meds for 20+ years at this point. Been trying to exercise because it really does help (sometimes), but when you add in long covid and other physical issues, that gets in the way. So *many* things can get in the way of getting better. I've made the decision multiple times to ""just take control of my life and depression"" and I always end up back in the same spot because some big life or health or family disaster sets me back. You can try to control yourself but there are plenty of things you can't control; only so much you can do in a sinking boat, etc. 

Hearing people say ""it will pass"" is so glib and out of touch as to be laughable. Pass *when*? For a few days, maybe a few weeks, sure. üôÑ I'm sincerely glad that's the reality for some people but for a lot of us it surely isn't.

You can do all the right things, take the meds, go to therapy, eat healthy, exercise, socialize... What are you supposed to do when you do all that and you *still* feel no joy, when nothing ever gets easier? Eventually it's hard to keep it up because the return on investment is so damn low! It really is just about managing it at that point, and it's a struggle to decide whether it's actually worth it, and I wish more people understood that."
"Dangerous but hard resets seem to do something. I literally hyperventilated the other day during a panic attack and passed out, and everything after was so much brighter! Do not recommend, but I can't argue with results..."
TMS and ketamine was my magic potion. I have been in remission for a year for the first time in my life (39F)
Why do we put up with it?
"Lifestyle creep. 

Sometimes it‚Äôs good. For instance, I work in sales and drove a 2003 Camry with 250k miles. 

I recently upgraded my car and feel so much more like I‚Äôm taken seriously. And even mentally too."
Cock and ball torture is completely free what are you talking about
"My heart feels for you, that‚Äôs a tough one, financial struggles are brutal. Hope it gets better for you."
Look at moneybags over here with something to count!
"Well shit, in that case I have infinite digits in my bank account, I'm rich!"
"Lived for so long just trying to get 1,000 in my account. Never had a moments peace. Now we're up to 5 digits and I'm less anxious but I still obsess over even small purchases. Old habits die hard I suppose."
"Maybe you've convinced yourself that financial insecurity is the source of your anxiety, but that's just the mask it's wearing."
You should spend a weekend with me partying and wasting money.
"Therapy, duckling. You've got some financial trauma."
"Having money takes away things to be sad about, but even the richest person alive can feel so hopeless that he wants to die. 

I mean people just gonna pretend Robin Williams didn't kill himself?"
This is so real. Thank you for sharing.
I also sit on the floor for a minute. Lol it‚Äôs all about making a slow transition
Mate you need to move somewhere cold. It will speed that process up a bit
Thank you. That‚Äôs helpful. There‚Äôs an old Twitter thread floating around that describes ‚ÄúThe impossible task‚Äù. Your advice sounds like a really good step.
Very very good advice.
"No Diss to the advice and story, i enjoyed them. but I chuckled at step 2 being shopping after drinking a glass of water. Big draw the fucking owl vibes"
"I'm sorry but there is something I don't understand about the small step approach. 

>Just drink water when you wake up every morning for 5 days in a row, that‚Äôs all you have to do.¬†

But it's not all I have to do. I have to do a lot of crap like cleaning the house and work and stuff. Maybe I'm being too literal but sometimes it just feels like insulting advice. Or am I not getting something I should?"

"What‚Äôs the correlation between alcoholism (previous or ongoing in your case?) and not wanting to give you Wellbutrin? Liver damage if you‚Äôre currently a drinker? 

Because with it stopping nicotine and food cravings I have to wonder if it has an effect on alcohol cravings too, in which case wouldn‚Äôt they be RXing it *more* for struggling alcoholics?"
"You don‚Äôt feel sadness, but you don‚Äôt feel joy either. You feel nothing, which sucks all color out of life."
"I felt like that on typical SSRIs (Prozac, lexapro) but not on Wellbutrin. It actually made me feel alive again. Goosebumps from music, feeling passionate about things again, moments of joy. It‚Äôs been a godsend"
"I am on a really low dose. 37.5 mg daily. It's a 75mg immediate release pill and I split it, taking a half everyday. 

My body fought with different meds, but this seems to be working, thankfully."
"I‚Äôve only been in on it for a little while tbh, but I had the opposite experience of some others above: it has made (is currently making) me actually feel positive emotions. 

Before that: bad stuff makes me feel bad, good stuff makes me feel zilch"
"I obviously don't know anything about you, just wanted to throw this out there. 

Depending on how long you've been on Zoloft, if you weaned off in a week, you didn't wean off. You could run into some real problems. You may know what you're doing, but I just wanted to point that out just in case."
"I'm glad you're still here, too. This life shit is hard, and right now, it feels a lot harder than it should be, but here we are. Nailing it every single day. I'm proud of you"
"YES! Thinking back, it started showing up around 8 years old. 13 is when it hit really hard, and it's been a snowball since. I'm 32 now."
"Just knowing can be validating, and it also gives therapists a better idea of a treatment plan should you ever try that route. It can also help with insurance paying for more things that may benefit you."
"I can only speak to my experience as an autistic person, but mine has been a difficult one in terms of the world. 

It can be on a big or small scale. On the smaller scale, I would get very depressed at work. I did a number of corporate jobs and found it incredibly distressing that we had rules that no one followed. In addition to an open office being sensory hell, even the awareness that people only wanted surface level small talk, and didn't really want to KNOW me was depressing. Especially given 40+ hours of my life are with these people.

On a larger scale, I find it distressing that no one is following what I view as the 'rules of humanity'. We live on Earth, which is a finite space, which means that there is a limit to how many humans can be supported. Yet, rather than working together to ensure we all have enough globally, wealth/resources are hoarded and somehow we think the hoarders 'earned' it?!?!?! And also expect the exact same of everyone (regardless that EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT WITH DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES) and use the ability to rise to an arbitrary standard as measure of 'is the human being worth having enough to SURVIVE'. Our power systems were put in place by our past behaviours, it's one big game of make believe. I don't understand why we haven't all stopped and looked around at each other and said 'hey, we made these rules, we don't have to keep them. Let's play by new rules until everyone has enough.'"
"Also not the person you're asking, but I'll try to elaborate as well. All of this is my own personal experience, every single autistic person is unique and experiences their world differently than another.



Being autistic in a neutypical's world is *distressing*.¬† If you aren't aware that you're autistic, it feels sort of like something is inherently wrong with you. It feels like you missed a class everyone else took. They all know each other, how to interact with each other, and how to interact with the world around them. You do not. And often, it feels like everyone else can tell. This leads to lifetime of awkward interactions, bullying, being unsure of one's identity, not having friends or proper support from adults, and just feeling very, very, alone. This can manifest as depression.



My ""inner world"" feels so much richer and makes more sense to me than the ""real world."" So when those two are incongruent, that causes distress. Or basically, when anytime I think I *know* something, and it turns out I don't or I misunderstood it, that causes an anxiety reaction. Sensory issues cause anxiety, reducing those is a huge help. And when I say anxiety, it's not just anxiety. Whatever this is, eats anxiety for breakfast. It's just, the most horrible, awful, agonizing feeling that has to explode out of me or I will die. I tried to describe it to my therapist as ""imagine the person you love the most just dies in a horrific, painful and gruesome way in front of you, now take horrible gut feeling and spread it all over every nerve inside your body, multiply times 10."" Now matter how loud I scream, no matter how hard I punch the pillow, no matter how high I jump, I can't get the feeling out until it goes away. That's why many autistic people self-injure by banging their heads, they'd literally rather bash their brains out with their own fists than feel this feeling."
"one example would be something that was diagnosed and treated as anxiety. after socializing i‚Äôd spend hours mentally replaying conversations to review where i went wrong. this took up an enormous amount of energy and interfered with basic functions like sleep. i hated what a waste of time it was, how anxious it made me feel and spent as much time trying not to do it as doing it. & i was prescribed an escalating amount of prescription drugs to curtail it (from benzodiazepines all the way up to antipsychotics.) 

once i learned i was autistic i was able to look at this behavior through a different lens. it wasn‚Äôt a bad habit or character flaw that could be fixed, it was just the way i was made. i was over analyzing conversations out of necessity- i didn‚Äôt come with the rules for successful social interactions installed so this was my way of figuring those rules out. it‚Äôs something i‚Äôll probably do for the rest of my life & not the waste of time i thought it was."
"I went to look at those tests, and the hard part is that I work in special education and I have training on how to work with autistic students. So when I looked at the tests I could instantly tell which answers were indicators of autism and which ones weren't. How do you do an accurate test when the test-taker knows what the questions already mean?"
"I was going to say, maybe it‚Äôs America that is causing so many Americans depression."
Did you feel better because you distanced yourself from technology and a busy life?
"It‚Äôs all about perspective. My cousins (who live in Ghana) thought I was nuts, until one moved here to the US. he fully understands now."
Having a window of time where it's gone and then you're tired afterwards is a godsend though.
I had a friend who took his own life despite the fact that he exercised all the time and had many friends. I still don't know exactly why he did it but he must have been going through some terrible things if it led to that point.
"When I got into fitness, I felt even worse about myself than I do now. Not in a physical way. I felt a lot more invisible... like nobody else cared about my progress and there was really nothing else left I could do to improve my life. I definitely spent lots of time sad"
"It‚Äôs absolutely possible that the ‚Äúhard‚Äù part is what‚Äôs not helping you. Human beings are meant to have a massive amount of low level aerobic activity, and *some* hard activity.¬†

Think of the pre modern era. Constant movement, have to walk everywhere etc.¬†

Try adding 45m-1hr a day of Zone 1 type stuff and reduce the hard stuff to 2x/week to compensate. Might be helpful.¬†"
It‚Äôs a drug thing. Erowid and such.
and what was the difference about methods when they treated you for adhd?
"Wow. Exact same experience here. When I got my ADHD diagnosis, I no longer thought that I was a uniquely fucked up/lazy/incapable/stupid person, and once I no longer thought that about myself, my depression (and a lot of anxiety) melted away. Glad you're doing better <3"
"Same here. I was told my depression was ‚Äútreatment resistant‚Äù because I was no longer really sad but I still struggled heavily with motivation, getting out of bed, and all that. I had told doctors previously that I‚Äôve always had issues like that but it was worse now. Turns out antidepressants can help with my anxiety, which would be great‚Ä¶ but that anxiety developed as a coping mechanism for my adhd and was the only motivation I had at all. Taking away the anxiety meant I literally could not force myself to get out of bed even while screaming at myself in my head. 

Finally a new psychiatrist I saw realized I had never been tested and was shocked because I‚Äôm also pretty classic presentation, except I‚Äôm a woman so it just never was thought of. Got medicated properly and I no longer met the criteria for depression within 6 months and started weaning off antidepressants. I still have anxiety but it‚Äôs also much much more mild now after therapy!"
"It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not cowardice. It‚Äôs that you want actually to live and have some hope. It‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt think you should believe either of those, and so you transform an active desire not to do something into a belief that you do want to do it but are too afraid to do so."
I think that's about as close to a true explanation as we're going to get: one size doesn't necessarily fit all.
same here. shrooms have helped my mental state overall but the trip itself on pretty much any dose is way too up and down to be considered a low risk ‚Äúcure‚Äù to depression
Having someone to share the fact that life is truly absurd really lessens the impact of that cold hard fact.
"Fantastic advice. The best thing anyone can do is try to setup a foundation for themself that allows them enough room to handle many of life's problems. Some of it will fall through, but the bigger the foundation the more likely you'll make it through it fine."
Exactly. Compassionate honesty is the way now.
"It does make sense, a lot actually. I‚Äôve been on this depression/anxiety journey as well, since I was 15 (27 now) and therapy did help a lot. 

I‚Äôve never done any medication (out of choice), but maybe I should‚Äôve. Thing is, I had some really good years from 2019-2021 where I did feel like life was good in general. Although my routine was a lot healthier back then. 

A really hard relationship from 2021-2023 and it all went down the drain. I‚Äôve had that switch from anxiety in 2023 and back to depression is the past 6 months, though deep down it was always there. Exercising and good habits do go a long way. But it‚Äôs always harder when you no longer feel connected to yourself and you feel this dark cloud looming over you constantly.

 I do believe better days will come, just not sure when. It‚Äôll always be there, I‚Äôm quite sure, just have to live with it.

Fuck anxiety though, 10 times worse than depression. It feels suffocating.
Best wishes to you :)"
"Yup. Anxiety is definitely worse. And the worst part is it feeds itself by the very things it composes you to run from and hide. It's ruined one of my most cherished relationships. Depression is horrible too but, in my experience it can be easier to get out of with the right people by my side. With my anxiety it felt like nobody could help me. Caused a lot of unnecessary hurt, which only made it worse. Really horrible."
"That‚Äôs a really common survival mechanism. You set your emotions aside while there‚Äôs a crisis, but you can‚Äôt do that forever so it pops back up to be dealt with once you feel safe. Probably helped our ancestors a lot in the not getting eaten by tigers department, but it does suck these days."
"Bro that's exactly what happens with my bipolar cycle and depression. When things are calm and outlook is good, I slip into depression. When catastrophe strikes or turmoil enters my life, I enter into a hypomanic phase where I'm energetic, solution driven, super optimistic, and go into hyper drive fixing what I can. If I don't sleep, then true mania manifests, but in my older years I'm very able to identify the precursors to full blown manic episodes and self-regulate. But easy times = depression, hectic life-altering times = feel good goal oriented happy living. Hypomania also brings anxiety, which isn't exactly pleasant, but it does keep me solution-oriented to whatever problems I'm facing."
"Same. If my brain has time to wander, it's going to wander the wrong way."
"Some of the most amazing RNs I worked with were useless (as in to perform necessary tasks to save someone's life.) They'd freeze. From dealing with horrible anxiety and depression since childhood, it was my time to shine. I responded very similar to what you wrote about."
People who grow up in crisis or high stress homes frequently stay calm in a crisis because it is normal. The absence of stressors is the abnormal situation in that case and you get hit with depression/anxiety because your brain is uncomfortable and waiting for normal to return
I totally understand this - am the exact same way
"That eased up for me when I got my adhd treated. I always performed best under pressure, the higher the work load the better. I think it forced me to focus in a way that kept my thoughts from wandering. Slow boring times suckedvand i had a hard time self motivating when the pressure wasn't as high. Now that I've got the adhd better controlled I can still kick ass when the pressure is on, but I can make more progress and stay on task in those times where things are less intense."
This is me. I‚Äôm still trying to navigate through the quiet times.
"1. Quit drinking (if you drink). Alcohol is a depressant, and it counteracts antidepressant medications. 
2. Move. Even when it‚Äôs hard. Go for a walk.
3. Eat healthy, but don‚Äôt deny yourself a treat when you need it. 

I would do well to do more of number 2 and 3, but quitting drinking was paramount. And I didn‚Äôt even have a problem."
"Making the effort to hang out with friends more. That's helped me several times. But it's easier said than done. The first time, my friends pulled me out of my shell, without ever realizing how much I needed it.

Another time, I realized I was depressed because I was spending too much time online with people who only cared about the game. So I stopped playing and hung out with other people, in person. 

It's hard for me now because my friends have grown more distant. But I started going over to one's house every week, and it's made a difference. 

Or get a new job. 

A change of scenery and a better salary sure can help. 

And I know all this is easier said than done, but even picking one thing and having a goal and working toward something you care about can help"
"I‚Äôve had it described that depression is like a comet; it comes back into orbit at some sort of frequency and under some conditions. 

Therapy studies its path so you have a sense of when it will be coming around. At first it might pass incredibly closely and be very scary, end of the world kinda thing, and as we study it we learn it will not hit you and cause damage. 

Lifestyle changes and therapeutic tools help you push its orbit back a little; maybe the interval is longer, maybe as it makes its pass you have special glasses so you can see it and it won‚Äôt scare you. 

With both of them in tandem you become equipped to handle MOST PASSES and while it never goes away forever it gets easier to accept it as part of the excitement (lol) of life. 

This is my favourite explanation to depression and/or ptsd"
"Yeah, I've had it all my life and it's kind of killing me. I tried all those things too. Sports helped, but kind of only masked the issue. Still working on trying to figure it out."
I had a complete and total existential depression breakdown this winter and have the hardest of life resets in progress. (Everything i own fits in 6 sterilite totes)I wish I could get my hands on shrooms to try micro dosing or something.  Its bad brain combined with life chaos.
Had a reset myself - after waking up from being under anesthesia I felt like a new person. There‚Äôs def something to this.
Sounds like you should try some somatic breathwork classes.
"I did TMS. No help. Also did spravato. Didn‚Äôt do much either but my god the ‚Äútrip‚Äù was unreal. Also kinda icky.

Edit. Super happy for you and your results."
Money. I‚Äôm scared in that regard. I‚Äôm fucking 48 years old and the economy is trash. I may never work in my field again. Or anywhere if I‚Äôm really unlucky.
"Most of it‚Äôs been housing for me, actually. In the area we moved to, it was roughly the same price to rent or buy (at least for a handful of houses) and we‚Äôve got too many pets to rent most places so we‚Äôve got a ~$1,400 mortgage instead of the cheap place we were renting from my in-laws. Yay bills! üòÜüî´"
o there's a price to pay
I hope so too i genuinely dont know if im very weak or its normal to feel trapped and stuck but its ruining me mentally and emotionally to the point of having nothing left of me
"I live in the Midwest so in the winter its cold, and I shower a lot fast in the winter after I take my clothes off lol"
It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs ever worked for me. People who tell you to just get over and it and ‚Äúdo whatever you need to do‚Äù don‚Äôt understand that that isn‚Äôt helpful advice
"Haha, thats fair. :)"
"I think maybe you‚Äôre misunderstanding the intent of practicing this way. It‚Äôs meant to help develop a mindset where 1) you realize the value of caring for yourself  and 2) have some tools to act on that care. For me, it also helped shift my thinking from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to clean the house because an invisible force (society, voices of authority figures, shame, etc) is telling me I HAVE to‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm picking up this mug and moving it to the sink because I value myself and the space I exist in.‚Äù By starting small and not overwhelming yourself with thoughts of ALL THE THINGS you have to do, you can begin to feel a sense of accomplishment and self-worth, that can eventually help you build habits that bring  more wellness and joy to your life. Does that mean all of the sudden loving your soul crushing job, or whistling while joyfully cleaning your house? No. But it could mean developing the self discipline to start and continue a hobby that brings you joy and makes the soul crushing job feel a little easier."
"That was my rationalization for wanting to try it. I had a friend who abused alcohol and claimed Wellbutrin helped with his cravings. I had a doctor and a psychiatrist who wouldn‚Äôt prescribe it because it can cause seizures if you drink while taking it. My current psychiatrist said if I don‚Äôt have a history of seizures, the risk is low enough and it would be worth trying. I‚Äôm so grateful for her, because it was everything I was hoping it would be."
"I don't feel the sadness but I do feel joy, I'm on 150mg and life is so much better."
"Yeah.. no low Lowes, bit no high Highs :("
"This is how I am anyway, without any meds"
"my psychiatrist had me verrrrry slowly wean off Zoloft from 125mg over the course of several months, and my anxiety was HORRIBLE at the lower doses. thankfully i‚Äôm past that and feel much better, but weaning is no walk in the park with these meds"
"No, no I have been weaning over the last few weeks, this was just my first week, totally without it.  That is nice of you to take concern, honestly!"
"You basically described what happened during my childhood as well... I'm 39.


Self medication with drugs and alcohol for 20 years didn't help either."
"This really clarifies things I've felt my whole life, thank you. I hope you don't mind, I saved this in case I'm ever trying to describe it to someone in the future."
I‚Äôm very social and have no problem striking up conversation. It‚Äôs the replaying at home and alone that eats me. Thank you for sharing.
They're not meant to be diagnostic. In an official capacity these are a pre-screen. High scores indicate there's a point in proceeding with a full evaluation with a psychiatrist.
"get a proper one done, its less filling stuff out and more an observation, at least it would be harder to lie even to yourself is my guess

just to be blunt; a lot of the RAADS-R questions could quite literally just be ""are u tard'ed, Y/N) and the lack of vagueness in the allowed answers seems really shitty compared to a quick look at CAT-Q

hell if you are young enough (<10) you dont even realize there was any test because it wasnt written at all ime"
"A combination of things.  Good people (staff, students, expats), slower healthy lifestyle, learning languages, exciting travel, etc. I'm an engineer and enslaved by technology today but still not depressed decades later."
"adhd is a dopamine deficiency/re-uptake issue, but depression is usually treated with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. adhd needs different medication."
"Now *THIS* is what I missed out on growing up in a fundamentalist Christian household. Never could get them to deal with the possibility there's nothing guiding us, and this is all random noise in the cosmic background"
"It honestly has been very helpful in my chosen line of work, but also sort of a loop.
It's useful in Kitchen work because there are many things that require immediate attention, and produce an immediate result when you address them.  I'm not talking line cooking, but when you are driving the bus 70+ hours a week, the ability to handle curve balls becomes essential. Staying calm is essential. Solving problems is essential.
Then suddenly when it's quiet and on your own time, it becomes very challenging to turn that shit off."
"I appreciate you. It's hard to articulate it but you fuckin nailed it.

An Ex GF described it like this-

""It's like you'll run into a burning house and save all the babies, kittens, and puppies like nothing happened, but then you will come home covered in soot and won't take a shower for 3 days because you are afraid that you'll get the tub dirty and I will get mad."""
"I've been working on getting a diagnosis but bipolar 2 has been suggested. I think I got too good at sucking it up and faking it. I don't get aggressive or nuts but exactly what you described.  I'll have months of hyper efficacy and accomplishment, then something will happen and it's like nosediving into quicksand and even though circumstances and my physical function are the same, I'm useless.

Hectic life altering times are 100% when you make moves. Then a few months later something as simple as doing laundry becomes nearly impossible. Then you think ""look at all the shit you were doing 6 months ago, effortlessly"". And today taking a shower, cleaning your apartment and putting pants on is nearly impossible."
"I wish I could control this, but I don't want to take meds for it for reasons (cost) so I don't,  and I don't know how to change it otherwise."
Nature abhors a vacuum. So if your mind isn't focussed on a problem then it fills with other thoughts
"Yeah, I always do well in a crisis. It‚Äôs like all the fears from my anxiety have prepared me for the moment. It almost feels validating. ‚ÄúSee, those horrible things I‚Äôve spent so much time worrying about really can happen.‚Äù Of course I might be balling my eyes out while running around and dealing with the emergency because my anxiety manifests with crying (which is embarrassing) but I get the things done that need to be done."
"Everyone who has worked with me complemented me on being able to deal with high-stress situations and I personally love it too because instead of worrying over failing I'd just snap into focus and deal with the issue. 

On an average day? Paperwork makes me want to kill myself, I procrastinate on organizing my stuff, and I fuck up filling up forms because my mind was wandering. 

I need to find me a line of work where it's all stress."
"I've experienced and handled most of the traumatic things relating to my family since I was young. My Boomer self absorbed narcissistic parents kinda pawned off deaths and funerals and logistics to their kids because ""they couldn't handle it."" 

I have spent my share of time in hospital for various injuries and am always very particular about being a respectful patient because the Medical Field shares a lot of Parallels with serious Culinary stuff, in terms of overall hours worked and curveball thrown where your response (emphasizing RESPONSE, not REACTION) can have a significant effect on a patient or the work environment.

We're all just people.

But I think you can relate to this.  It's like we idle in 5th gear. When situations that require rational and immediate thought/action come up, it's almost like you look around at everyone else freaking out, and you're like ""Welcome home. This is where I live. Now shall we get to work?"""
"That's what I'm working on. I spent many years saying ""I need vitamins and excercise and tasks"" and balanced a genetic predisposition for alcohol abuse with the fact that drinking doesn't make me ""drunk"", as in I was never sloppy or destructive, it was just the cheapest and most available medicine.

I called it my ""sunglasses"". It narrowed my perspective and slowed me down. Less input. Made me normal. But in a high pressure situation it's like things rise up to your baseline level of idling in 4th gear and shit slows down and all the pieces are there, and you don't need a filter."
"Excercise, therapeutic amounts of drugs, and problems to solve.  And acknowledging that it's never gonna go away, so you might as well use it."
I also try to make sure I cut down.social media usage when I go through some rougher times to help with my mood
"‚ÄùGo outside during the daytime‚Äù is absolutely critical to my mental health. Any reason, any excuse (or no excuse)."
"Pills didn‚Äôt work for me. Paxil delayed ejaculation so that was kind of mixed bag

Also Zoloft zaps were a weird one"
If you are on Colorado there is a psychedelics study on depression in Fort Collins still recruiting.¬†¬†
"Shrooms are fairly simple if you want a new, fairly cheap hobby. /r/unclebens will help you get started. Spores are fully legal to buy in most states."
Oh wow! I didn't know this happened to others. Was (and still deal with depression) depressed in teen years - had to have 3 unrelated surgeries. And after the surgery it totally felt like a reset had happened. The depression would come back but the relief for a few months was invaluable.

"Omg you are not weak. This is exactly how I felt when I went through this- trapped and stuck. Just remember life is fluid, it‚Äôs always changing and you might not even see it coming but it will change and flow as life does and it will work out for you. Lots of love"
Time will fix things. We've all been there
"Ah ok, thanks for the response. Lowering seizure threshold makes sense for the other doctors being wary, didn‚Äôt know or did that (more than other antidepressants). Glad you found a Dr willing to take a chance and it worked out so well for you."
"I've almost finished weaning off of Celexa after several months of tapering. I actually didn't tell my doctor because they often do it TOO quickly. You're right, these types of drugs are no joke. They have their place, but they're not to be taken lightly."
It‚Äôs a lot more sunny there too. Winter depression is a thing.
"So you permanently moved to Africa? Is it some kind of volunteering work?
I'm thinking to make this move as well. I was looking into Mercy Ships, to do volunteering there."
"Fuckin hell as soon as you said ""my line of work"" I knew you were gonna be a chef lmao. You hit the nail on the head"
"100% facts. I had a very challenging and traumatic childhood. Being able to fix things in BOH became very addicting, and I started working 70 hr/wk chasing that sense of stability and control. When I finally put 2+2 together, I quit and never went back to restaurant work"
Oh man. Your ex girlfriend is in my head. This is perfect.
"Really good analogy, I'm definitely borrowing this. Thank you üôèüèø"
"I'm no stranger to self medication. I used booze to deal with it for many years. Never lost a job, no legal issues, you'd never know I was drinking if we weren't making out or I was sweating profusely.

There are some things that are healthier than booze or benzos to take the edge off, but the unfortunate side of this type of nervous system is that the amount of shit you need to chill out becomes unhealthy, and then it's almost like you have to accept your mental limp and acknowledge its place in how you function.

We're always gonna be wired tight like a snare drum, but if we can recognize that and engage in healthy mitigation,  even positive application of this stuff, then it gets a little easier.

You gotta be tough."
Some people were just born to fight. Its all we know.
"Fair warning. They didn‚Äôt work for me, made me more depressed, but I‚Äôm not everyone"
1400/month would be possible to afford on on my salary alone vs needing 2 salary at 75k+ for the most basic of places.
"A little over 3 years, yeah."
"Hey, I'm only a Chef when I'm in charge. That word is heavy and gets thrown around a lot these days.  Haven't been a Chef in 7 months. Appreciate that you know what's up, haha."
"Yea, I'm in that comment and I don't like it."
"Same, and made me very restless with akathasia and feelings of confinement-which exacerbated the anxiety and worsened the depression. 

Thinking of trying ketamine though bc depression is so bad when it comes upon me about twice a month-sometimes for full weeks :("
"Doing shrooms without the right support, and even with the right support, is not the panacea they are made out to be. Great tool though"
