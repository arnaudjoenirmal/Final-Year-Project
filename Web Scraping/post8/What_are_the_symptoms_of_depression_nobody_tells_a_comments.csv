"Feeling fine. But in reality you're feeling nothing. You're unknowingly numb. Just cause it's unfamiliar. Not indifferent cause you're aware that you feel no way about the situation. Neither negative nor positive. 

Its an absense of present emotion. Cause there's no sensation for it.

Just: it's quiet, too quiet. Kind of ordeal. Yet you don't even know it's quiet. It's just onset and you're in it."
The tunnel vision. You‚Äôre in your bed or always wanting to be there. You don‚Äôt pay attention to things that require more energy so you make sure not to face it. The tunnel vision is mainly for your basic needs and the occasional distraction that is low energy because you‚Äôre so tired to begin with.
"Showers, I struggle to get myself into the shower to get clean, same goes with any hygiene some days."
memory loss
"having no hobbies. because you have anhedonia about everything. i can't even figure out what i want to watch on tv anymore, nothing sounds good. been wanting to get back into reading now that i'm out of school, but nothing sounds good."
"Time blindness. I‚Äôve been in bed for the past two weeks. It felt like a few days. I don‚Äôt have the energy to do anything else and the only responses I get when I ask for help are ‚Äòwhat do you mean you have no energy‚Äô or ‚Äòyou have to go workout‚Äô. I just feel numb, weak, and like the days are flying by but I‚Äôm not living them."
irritability. getting extremely upset over very small things or being easily annoyed by everything around you because you feel like the world is against you or you‚Äôre just done. it‚Äôs extremely draining.
"Idk if it's just me, but I noticed that I tend to have a lot of gastrointestinal issues

Edit: Firstly I want to thank everyone for answering. Knowing that I'm not the only one makes me feel both relieved and sorry. But I read all the comments and I'll definitely do some researches!"
I watch sad documentaries and videos and overall unhappy content. About tragedies or crime. This may be completely abnormal but I think it‚Äôs a result of the saying misery loves company.

"Not caring what you eat, not sleeping or sleeping too much, not exercising, ruminating thoughts, no joy in anything, unhealthy habits, isolation, angry, bitterness, jealousy, loneliness, hating yourself, feeling everyone else hates you, silence (not putting the tv, radio on), living in your head/in your own world, clamping you teeth shut or grinding them, back aches, heart palpitations, hating everyone around you, getting behind on chores, deep sadness, self sabotage, self harming, not washing, no attending doctors/dental appointments, memory loss, lack of concentration & focus, unable to watch films/telly without being distracted by your thoughts, emptiness, lack of motivation. Depression sucks"
"Self care. There are a number of warning signs that let me know I'm entering a depressive episode. My beard gets unkempt and straggly. If I find that plates, bowls, etc are starting to build up without me washing them up, that's a sign. Have I hoovered in a week? Another sign. When was the last time I had a shower? 

I have to be very vigilant that I don't allow these things to creep up, and I'm not always successful, but I'm pleased I can recognise when I'm going low."
The inability to look forward to things. The loss of self. The loneliness. Having zero drive.
"I'll never forget the permanent death wish. I think no one talks about it, because there is nothing to say. Nothing makes any sense."
"Even when you keep yourself busy with activities, it is just done to make bedtime come sooner. Busy is not happy, though many see it that way."
Body pain
"Someone here said memory loss and they nailed it. It feels like full on cognitive decline at times and I have struggled on and off with it for years now. Not only is remembering stuff much harder at times, but just understanding what people are saying, vocalizing thoughts, communicating effectively or doing anything that requires any brainpower feels impossible at times. It's a persistent kind of numbness : Not only can you not feel anything, but you can't think anything either. It's scary."
[deleted]
"ADHD like symptoms. 

Increased impulsivity, executive dysfunction, focus issues, etc 

I think a lot of us think we really just have ADHD when a lot of mental illnesses mimic those same core symptoms. Then people get really upset when a doctor suspects it. 

I thought I had it too but I have some major anxiety and such, as I got that under control more, my doctor checked in on me and asked if my symptoms related to ADHD were still as bad. They weren‚Äôt."
"Losing friends. The longer it takes you to recover the more you lose

Edit. And the irony is you actually need a support group to get out of that situation. Being isolated worsens the depression significantly. Force yourself to find some support!! It really helps!"
The mental gymnastics I have to do to make myself do anything.
"Literally feel invisible 
Feeling numb or wishing you felt numb 
Uncontrollable rage for no reason"
"For me it‚Äôs not being able to listen to music. Not because it‚Äôs sad or emotional, but because I get bored and just can‚Äôt listen to the entirety of one song. Like I just lose interest in it"
"The longing that comes after. Longing the life you could have had while you were depressed. Depression consumed my entire teen years. While I should have been having fun and enjoying the last few years of being a kid, I was stuck in hospital wards and being a prisoner in my own mind. Those are years I'll never have back. Now everything is all about finding a job and learning how to be independent and facing a world that rejects the human desire for fun and amusement."
"How it creeps up on you. 

I go through cycles of depression, and every time I just assume ""It's just me for today"" until it's been 3 weeks of lying in bed and not being able to talk or feel anything. I'll turn on the game console and just stare at the TV. I'll look at the work in my bag and realize I can't bring myself to do it.

Then the only emotion I can bring myself to feel is guilt."
Ruminating mind over here. I do nothing but think deeply about life. Life is my everything. Cause i'm alive and I'm ungrateful but due to the possibility of hell I have to remain here. Suffering until my day FINALLY comes. I'm an ungrateful soul that wants heaven and nothing else. Suffer for an eternity cause my late parents wanted to have another kid fml.
Intentionally hurting yourself in anyway
"That no one wants to help you. Everyone will either be purposely ignorant so you never ask them again or tell you to ask someone else. ‚ÄúEveryone loves you,‚Äù nope, no one does. There are over eight billion people, what makes you more valuable? Don‚Äôt even try to ask a professional because that title is just a mask. Don‚Äôt be human, we don‚Äôt like that title."
"Narcissism, or self-centeredness. It seems the only people who talk about it are medical professionals"
Memory issues
Not caring usually that‚Äôs a good thing but when you‚Äôre depressed even if you were depressed prior but I mean when you into a bad depression you literally just don‚Äôt care to the point where people look at you and think you‚Äôre on drugs because you‚Äôre speaking to yourself or you‚Äôre singing your song out loud in the store or at least for me there‚Äôs no anxiety because I don‚Äôt even care anymore about anything you don‚Äôt care to dress a certain way or be nice that one person that‚Äôs been an asshole to you which is kind of nice bone when you get out of that state you‚Äôre honestly kind of embarrassed
"No feeling of difference in going to different places. You can intellectually understand you're at the store, but it feels the same as being at home. Everything feels the same. Can't taste food. My MDD involves severe anhedonia though."
How your surroundings suffer as well. U barely wanna live- let alone keep up with the household
"Developing random allergies/a bunch of them for no reason. Chronic stress shoots ur histamine levels up constantly which gives u a histamine intolerance. Also just generally a ton of physical health issues. Some ppl are more prone to somatic symptoms, like me, so our mental illness really comes out in stuff like GERD or chronic migraines that can‚Äôt be explained. I learned in my health psych class that u can also have stunted growth due to experiencing chronic stress early in life (eg growing up in a chaotic household). I had such an epiphany bc I‚Äôm super short and no one else in my family isüëÄ."
Poor memory
Fake laughing when you‚Äôre hanging out with friends to get them off your back as they keep trying to get you to be social. Always looking forward to going home & in bed. Wishing for time to just stop & everyone could just pause for a moment so I could just BREATHE
Pushing others away and disliking being helped. Everything feels fake and forced. So you're stuck needing people yet pushing away those who try to be there for you.
Also abusing sexual actions. Or lack of sexual actions (that plays a big part in women's vaginal health too.)
One of my biggest symptoms is binge eating. When I start giving up on health I know I‚Äôm down bad.
"It feels like I dont deserve love, but I know sometimes I need just a hug or something. Just somebody to talk would be fine. But I dont really wanna get into a relationship, because I feel like it would be unfair for my Partner to struggle with a person like me. I need lonely time and what if my partner would not really understand why and what my thoughts are and what I am doing? 
Thats why a partner that I can relate to and that I can care for would be perfect. I want someone that I can understand and that can understand me. Its hard, but at first I have to find myself. But i still wanna have atleast someone. Im fine with being alone, im used to it."
"I get achy like I have the flu when I‚Äôm depressed. I don‚Äôt know why, but I am overall way more fatigued and my whole body hurts."
Quiet desperation.
"Not wanting to shower because you feel so bad about your appearance. Having difficulty brushing your teeth regularly, and you don‚Äôt want to smile"
"I would say how much energy you simply do not have to do anything. Sometimes, it feels like I've done 4 triathlons, and I haven't done a damn thing in the day. It's so frustrating.

I think I'd also say how lines are extremely blurred when you also have anxiety or another mental illness. Sometimes, I can't tell if these symptoms are from my anxiety or are they from my depression."
"Just being ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, I wasn‚Äôt sad, I wasn‚Äôt happy, and I wasn‚Äôt angry. I was just ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, a total and complete void of nothingness. That‚Äôs the best way I can describe it at least. 

Now that I‚Äôm all better, I did notice something else too. I looked back at photos during my depression, and I just looked totally off (especially compared to now, and before). I looked sunny and bright before, and for
Some reason, that made me the saddest."
"Absence of emotion. Every day feels like the same day. You're mindlessly trying to fill it with something to make you feel just...the slightest bit of something - but nothing works. 

Not taking care of yourself or your belongings. Maybe you skipped showering or bathing that day. Your hair looks fine, but you haven't brushed it. Your body aches but you don't care to take meds for it. You're just existing. You do just enough to look presentable. 

Tiny comments that make you overthink stuff. Realistically they mean nothing, maybe it was friendly banter or something along those lines. But you can't help but sit on that comment. No one knows. But it's there, just...repeating in your brain."
Pushing everyone away üòî
I feel like most people associate not having an appetite and losing a bunch of weight with depression but for me it was actually the opposite. I gained a ton of weight when I was severely depressed because eating became my coping mechanism. I‚Äôve since lost most of it but man now I associate my own weight gain with declining mental health
"Also,the ""laziness"" and guilt afterwards. We're not actually lazy, because lazy people don't feel bad for being lazy. Everytime I skip school because I feel too bad,I feel such incredible amounts of guilt even tho I'm only hurting myself. Idk,maybe it's cuz my mom is very passive agressive about it. When she asks me to do the dishes,and I don't. I feel so,so bad. 
I want to go to school,I want to do the dishes. My legs are broken. I can't. It's like something's stopping me from doing all the things I want to do."
Not feeling emotions (i'm part of the alliance btw)
rage and bitterness
"Depression can have various symptoms, including physical pain like headaches and stomach issues, changes in appetite, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and loss of interest in activities. Some may also feel emotionally numb or have heightened sensitivity to rejection. It's important to seek help from a mental health professional if you or someone you know experiences these symptoms."
"Feeling like you can't connect with others on anything. When I'm really depressed, I feel like I am the only person in the world having my experience and that no one can relate to me, and I cannot relate to others. When people try to relate to me it feels invalidating almost because my pain feels so extreme and unbearable that I cannot possibly imagine anyone else is experiencing something like it, otherwise, why would they still be here?

Difficulty being present in conversation. I'm usually a good listener but when I'm really depressed I can't focus on what others are saying, I'm too absent.

Returning to comfort people. Exes a lot of the time or people that will make bad decisions with me or are messy the way I am. Or people I know won't hold me accountable.

Masturbating a lot. Lol"
Complete Numbness. I checked out of my body years ago & I can‚Äôt remember how to check back in.
Apathy. Silence. Zoning out. Brain fog.
"For me it‚Äôs how tired I am. Other people don‚Äôt understand how I can be so tired all the time. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much sleep I get, or how many cups of coffee I have. There‚Äôs rarely a time when I‚Äôm not feeling tired"
"Sighing alot. I constantly feel heavy and tense in my jaw, chest and stomach and it makes it hard to breathe. I didn't know i was doing it until my partner pointed it out"
tiredness that you just want to rest so badly..
Having an incredible sense of humor. All the funniest people I know deal with some serious depression
Distrusting everyone because you haven't talked to anyone enough to be close with them and don't want to ruin their day or waste their time.
"Feeling heavy, hard and tough all the time  
Cold and physical pain. I was cold for years during depression"
"Plenty of people who are depressed may tell you they feel *empty*. But I'll tell you as someone who's suffered with depression now for a couple of decades what hides behind the *empty* feeling that one feels when they are depressed.

The symptom of depression that no one tells you about because they can't is *empty* \[\[**denial**\]\]. *Emptiness* is the feeling your body gives you to cope with trauma and emotions or thoughts you are tired of hearing from. It was so easy for me to feel like I was just sad all of the time... sad, maybe disgusted and *empty*.

The truth was that I was living a life of **denial**. There were things I thought I deserved or wanted that I felt like I tried hard for and that life just wasn't willing to give me. The truth is that life very rarely just gives you anything except for your birth into this existence. 

Now, we can keep allowing ourselves to feel *empty* \[\[**denial**\]\]. We can allow that to pervade through our lives, and continue to invite it. But the only way to make the gigantic pall *emptiness* casts over us go away is to challenge ourselves-- challenge ourselves to simply live a more stable life, going to that curtain and tearing it away, revealing the Wizard of Oz for who they really were all along-- **our denial of self, life, of living, and/or of existence itself**. 

Gathering the courage to do this, one can find themselves in a very liberating position-- at the bottom. Here, you can explore. Here, you get to set a little bit of a pace if you want to. You just came from a place where you thought nobody cares-- that's great! Use that, live as the person who you want to be, and so long as you're kind and peaceful yourself while pursuing whatever it is you want to be authentically? Who cares what the others think.

I should say that this was my personal experience with **denial**, so it might not be the same for everyone. I do believe it is the last thing you'll hear anyone say that they have as a symptom. Why would you? They are in complete **denial** of their own **denial**. 

This is NOT a call to all ""tough love"" people out there to ask all people who are sad to get out their hard hats-- all this does is make the *empty* feeling individual \*more\* disillusioned with reality and serves to drive one **deeper into denial**. What it takes to help yourself and others through their *emptiness* is empathy, compassion, and maybe sharing the little, stupid or funny successes, happenings, or other things you experienced with them to show that life doesn't have to be all that bad."
"A lot of people describe depression as ""feeling sad"" while I'm reality,you don't have really much of an emotion in possession. You just don't feel anything. 
Mood swings play a role too. For a few days,you may be crying over everything and all the time,and on the same week,just blankly staring at the ceiling not feeling anything.
Memory loss. No,not like dementia,but you forget stuff. Not what you ate for breakfast but your brain makes your forget memories that made you happy,makes you forget all the things and people you love. And then it creates an illusion that you've always been like that and always will,while it's simply not true."
Having intrusive thoughts get worse :| like thoughts about bad things happening to you of people who you care about
Pretending like everything in your life is great so you don't burden other people.
Stop going to any appointments I have and just don‚Äôt show up
"First thing I noticed is the moment you wake up, somewhere in your chest hurts. 

Also It feels like your soul left your body and your soul is watching yourself in a 3rd point of view.

You see yourself miserable and you wanna help the guy and all but then you realize it‚Äôs your own self that‚Äôs miserable.  That‚Äôs what makes it even harder.  Knowing that you‚Äôre completely torn inside but nothing will fix it.

Hope this helps."
"I had clinical depression for about a third of my life. One thing I never hear anyone talk about is that when you exit the numbness, your emotions can feel VERY strong and overpowering. You're feeling for the first time in who knows how long. For me, it's taken years of therapy to even learn how to even feel/express my emotions in a healthy way. (I was eventually diagnosed with BPD which went a long way in receiving correct treatment)."
I don‚Äôt like how relatable the comments are
"Recurring depression, the cluttered ness mentally, overwhelming feelings that just come out ALL KINDS OF WAYS.. sleepless nights, drug usage on overload. Eating too much or not enough.. loneliness.. like real loneliness. Not like mfs today ""I'm so lonely.""  ""I'm so sad."" But don't have a lock of SENSE what SADNESS and LONELINESS really IS... Random crying, feelings or worthlessness, suicidal thoughts or harmful activities. Hell even small shit like excessive spending and risky behavior. Lack of compassion, lack of work, lack of motivation. Like can't even motivate myself sometimes when I need to do simple shit like clean. Sometimes it's so overwhelming and people don't even know where to begin or end. Stressed cause you have no one to help you figure out what you need to do stm.. like so much. It's heart breaking.. some people can't even pull themselves up to bathe fr.... But when they do??? They feel so much better physically and a little mentally. That's what depression is all together. Symptoms and meanings."
"For me, it's the (probably) hours I spend every day thinking about how I'll off myself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"I‚Äôm seeing so many informative comments here; seriously, this is very insightful!! üôÇ"
"Unable to care about things no matter how much I used to. Unable to make myself matter, because that's effort. No joy in anything that used to make me happy.
Not actively suicidal, but not exactly helping yourself to live a good life.
Feeling unlovable and like you're just not worth any effort.
Not reaching out to anyone because you're a burden and you're tired of being a burden. 
Having no faith that you're actually somebody who deserves to be loved and who deserves happiness, no matter how much people say it.

Also, grieving who you once were. And realizing you'll never be that person again."
"My mind tends to be very busy and i can make all kinds of crazy connections quickly.  However during one low episode, the connections weren‚Äôt there.  My brain felt heavy and in a fog.   It was a scary experience."
Memory loss. Especially with prolonged struggle
Always telling others things are good too much! Unless you address an issue or want help it's not going to come if they keep ignoring it.
"Low libido, feeling numb, being tired all the time, not having the emotional energy to cry, etc‚Ä¶"
"Time. 

Four months to my husband watching me in bed felt like 3 days to me. I lost the timeline we all live by."
"There is a question in my head 24/7( ok, except when I am sleeping):""What is the point of doing anything?""

Every day is a same cycle, over and over.

Like you turned colorful picture into black and white....everything faded."
"Heightens ADHD, time blindness, harder to shower, eating disorder, utter exhaustion but won‚Äôt let myself sleep"
"Having extreme anxiety and ptsd can cause you to go into full-blown clinical depression. 

It's that bad."
"Getting actually sick. Headaches, fevers, rashes, etc."
Having to choose between hygi√´ne and food because you don't have energy to shower and eat on one day.
"People will never understand 
They can emphasize, but they will never understand the complete scope of it. Sometimes they will use it to gaslight you. Sometimes they might even say you're faking it when your symptoms go against what they know about pop culture depression. Even people who are depressed, everyone has their own symptoms. You gotta be there for yourself, people can only help you so much before they get tired. That's the tragedy of chronic illnesses"
"People never mention the cognitive impact depression has. It dulls your mind as well as your emotions. I've had depression for most of my life and I can sense my cognitive abilities getting worse at age 26 - from memory to concentration, it's all slipping."
"preoccupation with death. not just in the sense of your own death, but thinking about losing loved ones frequently, how out of control that is, etc."
"My worst one is feeling like you don't love your loved ones enough, not because you don't care about them but because you worry you don't have the same capacity to feel and connect with other humans."
Drinking alone every single day
"I've read that there can be physical pain. Some doctors have prescribed pain meds (e.g., Tylenol) for this."
Going along with things without really wanting to.
 Nit being able to handle silence (me at least) the quiet makes the thoughts louder to me
"I'd say self sabotage. I literally wanted to ruin my life, give up my career, my loved one's, just abandon everything and begin indulge in self destructive behaviour.

This was a symptom I didn't hear about until I experienced it( and continue to do so)"
"hygiene goes down the drain, using the bathroom means getting out of bed so you hold it for as long as possible, the pain that feels like electricity in your bone for me it's around my fingers, missing your hobbies hut having no motivation to do them, feeling trapped, eating only when you start to feel nauseated from not eating"
"I'm gonna be a debby downer, and it's gonna sting. 

""There is no escape"" 

even when things are fine, you know it's fleeting. Mr depression knows where you live, how you live, what you like and what you dislike, what makes you happy or sad. And he's always around the corner.

The good thing is you can tell him to fuck off for a while, and really appreciate the time he's gone."
"Actually my emotional memory is excellent, I remember every single feeling about every single situation. But my actual long and short term memory sucks."
"I‚Äôm not sure if this would be a symptom of depression or something else, but I tend to create stories of myself with people that don‚Äôt exist in my head to feel like I have done something."
not wanting to get better because it seems so overwhelming and there's some sort of comfort in being depressed
For me my focus is incredibly altered and I can get incredibly disorganized. I notice I tend to doom scroll a lot too and Isolate.
"I'm less sick when I'm on meds, and I recover from illness faster.
I grew up almost always ill, reacting to things others only get a minor cold from, constantly unable to function from being sick. On my old meds (not on any currently) I was almost never sick. Since I had to stop the meds I've been sick for weeks on end monthly or even bimonthly at this point.
I also have more abdominal pain and joint inflammation which gets worse the more depressed I am."
Depersonalization
Lack of motivation
"Random physical symptoms. I get these waves of intense nausea that come out of nowhere, IBS, back ache, muscle weakness - feels like you're walking through treacle, migraines, etc. 

There's nothing actually physically wrong, and as soon as the depression lifts, the physical symptoms go away."
"memory loss. it's like depression keeps burning holes in your memories, but others' would just say ""you're irresponsible"" or ""you should train your memory more"".¬†
it's debilitating and frustrating, but nobody talks about it, and that's what makes it even worse.
paired with no concentration and difficulty making decisions, it's no wonder people say ""you're so bothersome""."
"I'm really scared and I think too much about what people think about me. I'm scared and shy to tell my parents or anyone anything at all, they think I'm just fine. I can't even feel love towards my girlfriend that much. I never run in public because I think it's awkward and I don't like going outside since people will look at me and see how weird I look.
And being really fragile, I get upset and angry over small stuff, and I usually star tearing up whenever I talk about my feelings. I got much more stuff to say but I think this is enough"
"Feel dumber.. I feel my mind is getting less sharp learning new complex engineering related topics, fallowing up when other explain me stuff, or topics who had to do with long processes (legal related issues)"
"It can trick you into thinking that you're good and healed. For 3 years I've been working on healing and doing pretty much everything to become well again, then finally succeeding (or I thought so), just to fall back again after 1 year and start all over again. But with new symptoms. That's when I realized that I don't escape so easily from this. At the beginning I neglected my hygiene really bad, now I fixate on it, overthink it, bring a lot of hygiene products with me when I go out, and because of this there is more stress as well. Now I neglect my diet and eating. It's like my brain says Yes, you're hungry but no, you don't have to eat.¬†
Also something else that I've noticed and finally admitted that it's not healthy is fixating on animals or pets. Basically becoming obsessed with them, because you think that they are the only one that can understand you, so you lean towards them and become attached. This happened with my cats (and I wasn't a cat person), and when I lost 4 of them, I was devastated and blamed myself. Thankfully I overcame this somehow and now I can control my obsession, but it was a slow process. It caused me a lot of distress.¬†"
"having too much of an emotion it explodes that starts to leak. You can never know because you always hold in that emotion, you can be afraid of the causes. But then eventually, the cause comes out at the slightest moment of provocation."
"Not being able to be in the vertical, upright position without significant effort."
"I feel like suicidal ideation is more commonly known than the inability to do personal hygiene. Or the lack of joy in anything, even your favorite food, movies, etc. feeling blank."
"The more depressive episodes you have, the worse they can get. I don't know how many I've had, because when it started, I was little and I didn't know at the time that what I was experiencing were brief depressive episodes. It wasn't until I was older and experienced ones that stretched days, then weeks, then months, that I realized it had always kind of been there. TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation), CBT, medications, and EMDR therapy (a little), make it so that my episodes are shorter again and farther apart, as well as a little more mild, but it came at the cost of feeling like my emotions live on an island with my depression and I have to row a boat across a sea of nothingness to reach them, all the while having to thought stop the cruel and painful thoughts that pour through when I do."
Hygiene. I literally sometimes forget to take care of myself in the most basic ways
"struggling to complete daily hygiene tasks. i very very much struggle with taking showers. it‚Äôs not taking them it‚Äôs getting ready and doing it all. same with all the other stuff like brushing your teeth, washing your face, etc"
"In ages 7-17 they experience more headaches, stomach aches, and are less awake in the morning than adults with depression"
"Not really looking forward to stuff anymore... not sure if it's due to depression or just from ""growing up,"" but I remember looking forward to stuff SO MUCH as a kid, even little things. That new video game coming out in a few months. That new Star Wars movie in theaters that you haven't seen yet. Constantly checking the door all week for that lego set you ordered off the internet (back before package tracking was not nearly as detailed).

I mean there are things that I look forward to like vacations or a new episode of a show but it just feels like that enthusiasm used to be so much stronger. I miss that."
Food doesn‚Äôt taste like anything or tastes off. Music sounds annoying and would rather drive around in silence. Talking to anyone is more exhausting than helpful. Nothing is fun or enjoyable. Looking forward to nothing‚Ä¶. Basically anhedonia. I find no one knows what it is unless they work in the mental health field or have it.
Everyday feels the same
Feeling completely empty like almost an immobile zombie rotting away in a bed without caring enough to get out even with my own self care I just can't bring myself to do it or I might just be sitting there completely devoid of thought and forgetting to
staying in room
"Numbness. Depression isn‚Äôt constant crying in bed with a tub of ice cream and a chick flick. It‚Äôs just getting up every day and doing the things you need to do because you need to do them and nobody else is going to do them. But while you do the things you just feel NOTHING. No joy, pride, excitement, interest, nothing at all. Someone could walk into your workplace and point a gun in your face and you wouldn‚Äôt even flinch, you‚Äôd smile as you asked them to kindly pull the trigger. 

If you‚Äôre married or have kids it can and often does extend to that too. No desire, no interest in their lives, no desire for sex, no joy in family time, nothing. You can fake it very well for a VERY long time but sooner or later it catches up with you. It destroys relationships in a very insidious way. You don‚Äôt even realise you‚Äôve stopped being IN LOVE with your partner and your life. You might love them and want the best for them but you realise what‚Äôs best for them truly is you not being there any more, because you‚Äôre just no good. 

There‚Äôs so much more‚Ä¶"
"Mmy physical pain. It's common to have joint pain, headaches, etc.¬†


Also the numbness. It's like your brain gets tired of feeling so sad you can't breathe so you just numb out. You function, even appear normal but if someone could see inside they'd just see tv static"
The boredom. Because nothing feels the way it used to. It's like an itch you can't scratch.
"My body aches l, as though it‚Äôs crumpling in on itself"
"You will put yourself in high risk situations because you don't care if you live or die. Whether it's picking crappy partners or doing reckless things because you ""feel better"", you are doing things that someone who values their life/time would never do."
"Thinking you're ok and that you just need space, but you've needed space for 2 months now and you've not left your room and seen about a total of 2 hours of sunlight in all that time"
Mental isolation.
Physical & mental pain that people don't think are real .
Im talking about the older generations .
"Neglecting personal hygiene and living conditions for days to weeks at a time, due to mental exhaustion and feelings of emptiness/worthlessness and lack of self love and care for existence .And one could cause the other and vice versa, and either way they  cycle back and forth growing both the cause and effect until you finally get the energy and courage to fix a little thing that then gives you that bit of hope and motivation that grows and takes you out of your deep dark depression as you start to take care of yourself and your environment again."
"Body aches and pains.

Update: Oh and low immunity."
"You don't drink coffee anymore because you love it, but because you are used to it."
"The brain fog that makes it hard to function properly. It makes it hard to think straight. Often times you end up sort of spacey and unable to come out of it even if you want to. I end up working a lot more slowly at my job on those days, even if I‚Äôm aware of it and want to pull out of it. I just can‚Äôt. It can feel strenuous. All you can think about is going home and dropping all your obligations, even if you‚Äôre not feeling the classic ‚Äúsad‚Äù feeling of depression. It‚Äôs a more insidious version of depression that elicits a lot of behaviors associated with it. It‚Äôs better to just try and survive those days than fight it. You‚Äôll end up beating yourself up and more exhausted."
"Psychomotor agitation is one of the less talked one. This often involves feeling restless, fidgety, or constantly moving. It's not always talked about but can be a significant indicator of underlying depression."
Feeling like a burden to others.
"Masking it, you don't show you have you don't act like you have it, but behind closed doors. You do nothing but show symptoms."
Can't cry anymore. And not wanting to wake up tomorrow and thinking without future.
"Constantly tired or hyperactive 
Lack of appetite or increased appetite 
Lack of libido or increased libido
Wanting to isolate or go out more (be reckless)
Digestive problems and stomach pains 
Back and neck pains"
"One big sign/symptom that seems to go unnoticed, I think, is the self-perception of diminished mental capacity. Feeling stupid and looking at everyone else as being so much smarter than you, which is only exacerbated when you catch yourself  fucking up on the most basic of tasks. Common sense isn‚Äôt even a thing. And if you‚Äôve got anxiety, which commonly lines up with depression, that also makes those self-perceptions a lot worse."
"The longterm issues.   
  
People suffering from recurrent depression have a higher risk for a weakened immune system or impaired cognitive functions. And these are just the medical issues. People might have an impact on their jobs leading to financial problems. A depression strains the relationship to the people close to you.

And people suffering from depression are prone to substance abuse.

It really has an impact on life and it sucks."
"The tunnel vision only seeing one thing that's ""good for you"" but in reality laying in bed all day isn't. 
Going through daily life on a numb roller coaster, Some days you're numb to where your brain is tricked into feeling good but some days it's so unbearable numb and you just can't function and do daily tasks...
Not taking good opportunities and instead you just withdraw ""nah I'll just do it another day or something"" or worse you withdraw from talking and you lose all your friends and now your lonely and seen as quiet an weird and now everyone's alien to you and you can't even form a simple fucking sentence to save your fucking life. 
It's just so fucking infuriating it's just there a dark blob and it's there mocking me from what I once was when I was a kid I just don't understand it. As a kid I always thought depression was a joke but it seems that has caught up to me imma just stop this is a rant now sorry"
"Fatigue. I'm always so god damn *tired*, even on days when I do manage to sleep/eat/take care of myself. People will say depression causes you to sleep more, but they don't tell you about the sheer levels of fatigue you have in your waking hours just from existing."
Feeling like everyone hates you or is mad at you.
"robot mode: you dont enjoy life, friends, eating, nothing

emptiness: you feel an empty thing in your chest

poor hygiene and bad eating habits arent talked about enough"
Anger. It's not a silent issue but it's definitely not talked about enough. Things changed a lot for me recently upon realising that my anger issues are pretty closely connected to anxiety and depression.
"loss of concentration, passive death wish"
Disassociation. Feeling like your former self is lost and you are just observing and trying to get it back but wondering if you ever will...
"Depression induced psychosis or paranoia. Sometimes when depression is deep, it‚Äôs easy to think everyone hates you. Or to generalize things as bad that aren‚Äôt all bad. Black and white thinking. Despair when you‚Äôre in The depths. Trudging through and Forcing yourself to do things you ‚Äúshould‚Äù be doing in hopes that eventually you‚Äôll feel something again. Distrust in people and places."
Hair loss and feeling cold all the time. Am I the only one who experiences this?
Rumination.
"Being the ""happiest"" person in the room is often a show"
You can experience all or no emotion during depression.  Some people express it differently.
"My heart literally hurts. It happened after my dog dies a few years back and that pain randomly appears. 

The memory loss to be is a BIG one. I literally can't remember anything before highschool. I am 20. I should remember details of my highschool. 

Bed rotting. I can may in bed for 6+ hours awake and it feels like I was only there for like 1 hour. Since I basically disassociate the whole time. 

The numbness. I have so much going on mentally so when something happens noting phases me. I could care less if I am hurt or if I die. I feel nothing."
Complete apathy. About everything. Nothing is joyful. Nothing holds my attention. Nothing makes me laugh.
"the numbness, i haven‚Äôt been able to cry since i got diagnosed with depression in April 2022"
The body aches I literally can‚Äôt move or have trouble being active
Hair loss.
You're generally unmoved by stuff that would normally move anyone. Like just nil reaction to anything. It may seem stoic but its more of a numbness and unable to feel at the present time
"How it feels scary to talk about cuz if others haven‚Äôt felt it, I don‚Äôt want to be the one to introduce them to it, some part of me feels like it could be contagious .. like if i point out how it feels like life is continuous suffering knowing we and everybody we love are going to die to somebody who never thought about it then I‚Äôm gonna feel like shit like I pissed in their milkshake. 

I also don‚Äôt want to talk about it cuz it‚Äôs depressing and feel like it will run people away cuz who wants to be around somebody all sad and depressed"
"Constantly wanting to be home or feel at home, but never truly feeling you are."
"Self hate or lack of self love. I've had Treatment Resistant Depression my entire life. I've also hated myself for most of that time....still kinda do. I have a hard time with it. I try to forgive myself for things i've done, but it's weird because I blame myself for things that were beyond my control. For instance, my parents brutalizing me for the first 4 1/2 years of my life before I spent 14 years getting the same treatment in foster care. The whole time, hating myself."
The brain fog. I just finished TMS and I‚Äôm amazed at how I even functioned before
"Not wanting to k*ll yourself, but not having any interest in living. Therefore, you make no progress in life. You are stuck in an empty, senseless, pointless life until you decide to change. Which may take forever. You lose oportunities, your life shifts from the level your peers have. You get stuck. It's fucking sad."
The awful stomach and digestive pain üôÉ the mind-gut connection is strong
Not being able to remember what I was doing that morning nor being able to imagine what I'd do that evening. It was the most in the moment I have ever been in my life and I learned a lot about living in the moment.
"You push folk away because you're so moody and everything gets on your nerves¬† , so critical about everything,¬† jealous of others having great looking lives and relationships from what you can see, not wanting to die but tired of living this way.. isolation ,"
"Disinterest. 

Disinterest in hobbies. Disinterest in performing essential functions. Disinterest in anything that requires any effort.

There are times I will lay in my bed on my day off and then I notice that now it‚Äôs dark outside."
memory loss
"Maybe this is more well known, but I think of how even when I am in a good mood and things are going well, the depression is still there. Its hanging around like a mistake in the middle of a painting you spent years on, only to realize the mistake too late and the painting is ruined. Sure you can appreciate the parts you did well, but there's always a hole inside that you can feel, even if you dont know how it feels not to have it there."
Definitely selfcare and irritability
Your hair getting knotted because you're not brushing it properly or at all for like 2 weeks. And some other basic things that you don't feel like doing. I left a broken tooth alone for ages.. Boy did I regret that one in the end.
hygiene issues
Moving extremely slowly
Feeling uncomfortable with the thought of being happy.
"One of my personal signs of depression is ‚Äúauto pilot‚Äù feature. I suffer from PTSD and Bipolar Disorder, whenever I‚Äôm in my lows I‚Äôll turn on what I call auto pilot, where I‚Äôll just do the essential tasks, have a mandatory conversation or two, go home eat then go to bed and do it again until I just snap out of it. It hurts the ones around me a lot because I try to help them understand but they don‚Äôt understand and get upset when I get that way. It‚Äôs like a low power mode. Hope all is well OP."
"For me, only being able to eat breakfast food."
"Memory issues. Feels like your brain turns into cheese when it comes to remembering stuff, either important or not. And to be honest, it feels like a permanent thing. I've been treating for depression and anxiety for a few years and my memory hasn't gotten any better. It makes me feel like I live in this permanent page piece where I can barely look back and I am constantly loosing other pieces."
You feel okay one day and the next day you are a mess.
Being in your own comfort of mental illness
"What happens after a particularly bad depressive episode. It‚Äôs like you finally start realizing how badly you screwed everything up. Not even so much realizing, it‚Äôs just now you‚Äôre starting to care. I can‚Äôt really explain it but I wouldn‚Äôt wish the hopelessness and guilt on my worst enemy. I hate this disease"
"Wanting to do things but not wanting to do them. I don't know if you'd label this as anhedonia but I recently got a Planet Fitness membership. I want to go to the gym to tome my body up and use the massage chairs and tanning beds, but I also don't want to go, and then when I don't go I feel guilty for not going. Not sure exactly what this is called but this is a huge struggle for me right now."
"You look cheerful most of the time but that facade disappears as soon as a trigger appears. Your emotions will hover on the extreme either end of the scale. 

There will be days you're so motivated that you can accomplish many things. Other days, just 1 minor thing will break your flow till something gives you back that motivation again. (no, it's not money)

1 more unknown symptom - you will automatically attract narcissists, psychopaths, sociopaths because they love an easy target for manipulation. No way around that."

I've been this way for over 7 years now with many ups and downs. Realising that I slowly lost Connection to my friends and many of them just slowly disappeared. And its hard to make New friends while have of the time my self esteem gone. So loneliness apeared. I think that many circumstances effect each  other in an unfavorable way.
"Not feeling motivated about anything. Past hobbies are unenjoyable. Overly fatigued even when you hadn‚Äôt done anything. I also find my self being forgetful, you will also experience constant change in your diet, I usually don‚Äôt eat that much when overwhelmed, but also resort on food when I‚Äôm feeling sad"
"I don't think enough people talk about it but I've realized one little thing can piss me off to no end. (Reminder that depression isn't an excuse, it's a cause.)"
I'm baffled of how precise you've put that vague feeling into words ... And thank you for that
"Being apathetic is so trash but so nice sometimesüò≠. It was the first time I knew what it was like not to be depressed or anxious constantly, but I also didn‚Äôt care about anything. I had no interests in doing anything and the things that normally brought me joy didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs so easy to misinterpret this feeling as being okay/happy."
This is how I feel everyday. When I'm at my calmest. There's nothing. And I feel so weird.
"I felt this. I get like this and then one day when ira been months I break down in tears and sob at how much I been numb. It pours out, I also can sleep as much as I want. It‚Äôs a talent that I possess so when I‚Äôm depressed I activate my sleeping talent haha and feel better when I‚Äôm asleep. No pain"
"It's been said, but I just wanted to voice out.

I think Apathy is a good word for it. Constantly stimulated by stress, eventually one grows numb to it - with or without your being conscious of it. A coping mechanism, an automated defense for some because they know not how else to deal with the chronic discomfort.

Soon, you lose interest in most things - social interaction, hygiene, hobbies, food. It goes beyond apathy into avoidance where everything has a potential for stress and some things remind you that are not yet apathetic enough.

Then you start being apathetic about life... üò∞"
I remember when my anti-depressant medicine started working because I was waking down my hallway and all of a sudden realized I was experiencing feelings. It shook me to my core and I started crying because it wasn't clear just how numb i'd been until I was coming out of it.
I think that‚Äôs what Pink Floyd describes in Comfortably Numb
"Oh

Oh fuck"
"This explains how I feel most of the time, feeling like an empty vessel not particularly attached to anything but just existing."
Nailed that description fr
Oh wow! That describes how I feel exactly. Thank you! Not sure what I am going to do with it but I am glad to have it to think about.
Yes
Damn..... I thought that was just my defult setting in-between periods of the big sad.
"And having to fake emotion for the rest of the world. Ugh. It‚Äôs exhausting, and we are already exhausted."
I know how this feels. It's just a constant state of dissociation.
"I was on depression medicine for a couple years in my childhood and literally will powered my way out of it. I just divorced my wife of 16 years and didn't know why but something felt slightly familiar. This is the exact feeling (or lack thereof) and mindset I get. I get asked ""What's wrong"" to which I reply ""Nothing."" And then proceed to talk down to myself in my head."
It's definitely bazzar - I am not sure if there's levels to being numb.. but one time I was so devoid of emtotion..  I was convinced my soul had my body- I felt the empty space where my soul use to be.. I felt like a robot like a statue. the connection that tethered me to earth was gone. Very weird. Completely bahzzar but sometimes I want it to happen again. Emtotionally I need a break from all this grief.
"My favourite way to describe this feeling is ""idk, it just feels like the color gray""

Last week i went to an amazing event with one of the top dj's with all my friends, my brother was there, we danced, did rec drugs, had fun, chillaxed. But the next day it was all gray again and all i can say is ""ah, this again, well whatever""."
Well said. It‚Äôs such a strange moment when the overwhelming acute sadness just fades into this void of feeling. Like you said‚Ä¶ too quiet‚Ä¶ neither here nor there.
so real
I've been struggling to put how im feeling into words for like half a year and you just did it Thank you so much T-T
"True indeed .. being  less responsive, not excited about stuff anymore, it feels as if let it be things gonna change on their own and if not then too it's fine ."
This is so relatable.  Thank you so much
"Feeling ""fine"" really just means...Fucked up, Insecure, Emotional, and Neurotic."
Once when I was complaining about my friend/roommate never wanting to come out with us to my therapist at the time (I had depression too but used drugs and partying to cope at the time I was 19). I couldn't get how she could sit there all day and then get angry and offended when I pushed her to do stuff. My therapist said depression is one of the most selfish conditions but it's because you shut down and only focus on your basic needs. You sometimes don't even want that. Your entire world is focused on you and your pain and you can't see any farther than that. She said it better than that but it had a big impact and I think of it often. Even in my own depressive episodes when I was older and DID start isolating. It helped me realize I need to look outside myself or I will keep falling into that hole.
"I‚Äôm the opposite. The bathroom has always been my ‚Äúsafe place,‚Äù so when I‚Äôm going through a really depressive episode, I might shower three different times a day. I‚Äôm not really cleaning myself, but just sitting down in the water and crying or dissociating is my go to comfort."
"Get myself into the shower
Stay inside there for an hour
Barely get back home on time 
I'm just fine"
I've found moving weirdly helped with this. shower in the old house I hated so much. but the shower in my apartment is fine for some reason. which is ironic since my shower now has a window in it that looks outside so you'd think I'd be less comfortable with that
[deleted]
THANK YOU
That's a huge one.
Thisssss I barely remember high school
"Very real, I can‚Äôt even remember recent events in my life"
[deleted]
I have like a month where I get really into something and then my passion dies and nothing is interesting for a few monthsüò≠
I just got myself back into reading. What worked for me was reading a ‚Äúkids‚Äù book that I had already read before. (Percy Jackson series) It‚Äôs an easy story and comforting since I‚Äôve read it before.
"This used to be my problem until I started branching out. I looked into more than just TV/PS and books. Now I enjoy diamond painting, nail art(gel nails), felting, Pokemon cards, Zelda and Pokemon on my Switch, mobile games, and coloring. 

I realized I was in a rut, doing the same thing all the time made it worse. Of course I do have days where I struggle to enjoy any of them but that's when I take out an audiobook and push myself. I try hard to be conscious of it to not be stuck in a rut"
"Same. Reading, woodworking, ice skating, any sport, slowly even gaming, i lost interest over time, and i dont have any hobbies to replace these lost interests."
"Dang. Now have a word for what I feel, thank you for that. I always feel so guilty inside while with friends or doing an activity with a loved one because of this feeling."
"This feels so true. I have a vacation in school, and i don't like anything at all. So i just study to kill time. I will read books after getting to college."
"The way choice is based on how much energy you can devote to it. I want to watch anime, but it feels like too much to start. I want to embroider but it's too much energy to keep going and follow along with instructions. I want to read, but I can't get through one paragraph. It's hard"
Saaaame! Us the worst. I love watching TV lol
"Same :( 
It's like ""I could do this, I love this. But now I don't want to... maybe that? I used to cry about not being able to do it, but now... or maybe this? No. How about just watching a series? But which? They all sound bad now. Maybe just go on social media? That doesn't give me anything either... maybe just sleep? Maybe, but I don't wanna do that either..."", like no matter what you could or could not do, it all feels terrible :/"
Take care friend! Just don't stop showers and wearing clean clothes. Small baby steps to stop yourself from going further south.
"Yeah, same. Hoping I make it to work tomorrow."
"Same, i havent even gotten to live the past 4 years. Its literally been a blur."
Hold my beer! I've been like this for 6 months..
"Wasted the whole semester like that :/ 
Then at the end it was so difficult to catch up because I didn't feel that much better but all of a sudden had that huge work-load. Somehow I got through exams, just hope I passed them all.. but it was tough, I had so many headaches & just took pain killers, only took breaks when I got tinnitus. I'm sure especially with the headaches or the sudden workload a lot of you can relate."
"This is a big one I'm struggling with right now. My boyfriend has been asking why I'm irritated all the time lately. I'm just upset, but he's a fixer and there's nothing he can do at the moment that would actually make me feel better outside of winning the lottery so I just don't discuss it. I expected to be so much further at this point in my life, but I try to remind myself that I have a roof over my head every night and a kitchen full of food so I'm doing alright. It's hard though"
"Ye, and I always want to turn around and just punch a hole in the wall."
Thanks I know this because this is me‚Ä¶
"definitley not just you. there‚Äôs a direct link between mental health and gastrointestinal health. research is quickly elucidating that relationship, and most say to improve your gut is to improve your mental health"
As someone with a litany of mental health issues AND IBS your gut and your brain are the best frenemies.
No wonder why I stopped having stomach issues after taking antidepressants... and antacids
"I could go on about this so much! Fun fact, and this is back by research, Asian-Americans and African-Americans are more likely to experience somatic symptoms and experience more of them. So if u got any physical health problems and they haven‚Äôt been able to figure out why, maybe consider it being related to your mental health."
"My stomach makes the weirdest sounds when I'm anxious, and then I'm worried someone will hear, which just makes me more anxious"
Came here to say just this.
That‚Äôs when I know I‚Äôve been really stressed or anxious. Anxiety poops are definitely a thing!
"They say you have a second, miniature nervous system in your digestive tract. I experience digestive issues too. Knowing this makes a lot of sense. You feel so much in your gut, and if it‚Äôs not happy it doesn‚Äôt work right. They even say a large portion of serotonin is found in your gut too."
That's directly related to anxiety
"This 100%, though I firmly believe it's more the other way. After I had severe irreversible GI issues, my mental health has never been the same. I've done / do everything humanly possible but never the same.

As soon as someone presents with GI issues, GPs should flag this as a mental health precursor. It seems ludicrous to me that with most serotonin produced in the gut, it being called the 'second brain', and the Western world in a mental health crisis (surprise surprise, our diets are absolute garbage)....that this isn't the case already.

To answer the question though, my first indicator is loop thinking. Instead of just passing, bad thoughts keep repeating over and over. Then it's time to buckle up for the downhill rollercoaster."
"Oh goodness, same!  
It's always either one extreme way or the other :("
"Documentaries, weather disaster specials, and murder shows for me."
Yes! I‚Äôve done this and it‚Äôs like I am trying to make myself feel worse but it hits a certain spot that I can‚Äôt quite explain.
"Probably majority of the stuff I consume is negative, I wonder if it makes the depression worse but I just can't watch happy shit when I'm depressed."
"I binge conspiracy and true crime content, not specifically for the negativity that comes with it, I just think it's interesting. I don't even emotionally react to most cases anymore, I've become so apathetic and numb to it"
r/2meirl4meirl
"Well put. I‚Äôm not oblivious to my behaviors, I just can‚Äôt.. don‚Äôt want to stop them. It is a strange cycle"
"HAH i dont grind my teeth, that means im not depressed!"
Most accurate description of depression
"I made sure to scroll until I found this.
When depression hits, there‚Äôs a lack of self care.
Self care helps in dealing with depression, but when you‚Äôre unable to muster anything to care for yourself, you are going down the spiral. Thanks for mentioning this one"
"Bro, I made this realization earlier today. I was feeling really irritable that I was snapping at everything so I went to take a shower. Definitely felt better!"
"yea this, it sucks and i feel so bad for not looking forward to meeting people i like"
"Yep. I don‚Äôt necessarily want to die, but I just don‚Äôt want to be *here* anymore."
You may leave depression but depression will never truly leave you
This
So like do chest pains count??
"Bro **THIS** is the one. 

This gets me every time and I hate experiencing it. A lot of people will contribute it to ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre just laying in bed all day‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not being active enough‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not getting enough vitamin D from the sun, just go outside!‚Äù But there have been several times where I was depressed and still managed to be perfectly active, yet the pain still persisted. 

Literally, the last time I was depressed; I traveled to another state with my parents for vacation and we woke up early, ate really nice meals, went hiking, went shopping, and we even had a hot tub to relax in at the end of the day AND I got amazing sleep‚Ä¶ yet, my shoulders ached SO bad the whole time and my stomach also ached terribly, even though I was eating really nutritional meals. I notice my depression pain/body aches always occur the most in my shoulders and neck‚Ä¶ idk if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm tensing them or what, but nothing relieves it. I also get terrible aches in my leg muscles where they feel sore for absolutely no reason.

I feel that a good massage is the only thing that would loosen up all the aches."
"When I was evaluated and diagnosed with major depressive disorder this past fall, my iq was 35 points lower than I‚Äôd previously been officially tested at"
"I wonder if the memory loss is from the not caring about anything?  As in, I don‚Äôt care enough about anything so why would my brain bother to remember it?"
"Fumbling things is a big one for me, it's like my physical coordination gets wrecked. And the short-term memory/forgetfulness issues, 100%."
"I feel the same, when I try to write somrthing at school I just write the wrong words and letters, happened several times writing this reply"
"Reading these comments made me realise just that and your comment seems to confirm it. Shit, I should see a therapist."
ADHD *causes* my depression and anxiety üôÉ
"Real, they don't seem to care so they just go"
"For me, I get hyperfixated on a band/album/song and listen it to death and then hate it for a few months."
"I'm in a similar situation, but I'm still a teen. Everyone else is having fun and having a good time except for me. I feel way too anxious and my personality changes depending on who I'm talking to. I can't be myself"
"This. I can't really do anything so I just stare at my phone all day when I have tons of work to do for school, then when my phone dies I feel guilt and regret, like I could have done so much stuff in the time I just wasted. Happening to me right now"
"This is exactly how I feel, If eternal peace was promised count me out of this, I genuinely don't wish to live anymore. The more I try to get help the further away it feels, it's becoming harder and harder to reach out and I just want to drown in my poisons and substances."
"im sorry you feel that way and that that‚Äôs been your experience. im not going to feed you some bs about how it gets better because while it does, it sucks in the moment. mental health professions (in my opinion) do need better training. i don‚Äôt know how old you are or exactly what your experience is but i started experiencing depression at the age of 14 and i reached out to multiple people. people who i thought would do something to help me but no one did anything. i was alone till 21, until a healthcare professional reached out to me to help. 

i am sorry that your experience has been bad but i promise you there are people who can help you. please don‚Äôt give up hope. im here if you need a chat ü´∂üèº"
"This! When I try to talk about how I feel to other people they get soooo uncomfortable. They say you're not alone, talk to somebody and when you do, it makes you feel  like your depression is something to be ashamed of. This is the reason why I started to isolate more."
This may not be a symptom but a result of
Real! I really want help but then when I actually get the option to get I'd rather not.
Could you please explain a bit more on that?
This hits
"I've gotten to at least brushing my teeth twice a week, which is bad,  but it's better than once a year. Sometimes if I can feel the plaque I'll use a dirty shirt to just scrape it off which I think works after a mint."
or being comfort person...
I'm so sorry. BPD can be very overwhelming and life ruining. I really hope you're doing better now and are in a great place.
Depression is oh so great
"Me too. I'm not depressed, just some lazy ass bitch, but almost everything was relatable, even pain comments"
"Kinda surprised that I‚Äôm not seeing more of this. I used to only get sick 1-2 times a year, as my depression has progressed, I‚Äôm now getting sick every few weeks"
I agree to a degree. I can't exactly tell him what to do. He tells me what to do.
I don't really think nobody knows it's a symptom of depression
"That's not a symptom nobody knows about, every conscious person does"
"Those are the symptoms of ED, did you eat well?"
I had a friend tell me repeatedly she just wants to be numb. Then I finally experienced it for once. So now I know about to be able to identify it.
Yep! I think this explains what experience and I‚Äôve not been able to say it like this
Apathy is the word
Way to pin point it.
Perfectly explained
"Is that the term for it?

Apathetic.

Or are you just saying?

Cause that makes it even clearer. To know exactly what the world recognizes when conveying the issue."
"it‚Äôs like the chaos and that sadness becomes the norm and then when you do feel fine, it feels almost empty. i spoke to my therapist about it and it was so strange to say this but i told her that i almost found comfort in my sadness and depression. i was so used to feeling that way that it became my normal"
It can be unnerving for sure. Glad you're aware of it. Now you know what it is. Discover what makes you numb. Then uproot it. If you can. No pressure. No stress.
"You got a cheat code? NO FAIRüò± 

BREAKDOWNS!!! So refreshing."
"Lw this just sounds like being BP, coming from someone who has it. When I‚Äôm hypomanic and feeling good I don‚Äôt sleep but when I‚Äôm depressive I will sleep 24hrs easyüòÇ may consider talking to ur psychiatrist about being BP because a big place it shows up is in your sleep patterns"
That's the wrong word. Anhedonia is the right word.
I had the opposite lol my mood stabilizers made me apathetic and I initially mistook it as ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs working‚Äù whereas now I‚Äôm like okay my dose was too high
Are you about to make me go explore and find whose soul i'm connected to? Curious. BrbüòÅ
Glad. Clear understanding and knowing is part of the battle. TAKE DOWN YOUR OPPONENT!! üòÅ
‚ÄúYour entire world is focused on your pain‚Äù. Yes. I have the hardest time doing things for other people bc I‚Äôm in too much pain to think about others
"Depression is the sickness of the will.

When even getting out of bed is a herculean task, being asked to do anything else is the equivalent of doing the impossible.

Some people just **can't**"
no cause i think im doing this subconsciously and idk what the cause is for it or what's wrong with me and i feel more shitty because my boyfriend is all worried and all i can think to say is that my social battery is dead cs idk how to word the things going on in my head properly???
"First of all, I‚Äôm obsessive compulsive so it‚Äôs a rare day I don‚Äôt take a shower even if I feel crappy. But I get what you mean about it being a sort of safe place. They‚Äôre quite and isolated from the world, much like a bedroom. I find I accidentally take too long in the shower because it relaxes me enough that I sort of tune out from the world. When my symptoms (or even just stress) are flaring up worse, the longer I take. Sometimes I even need to set a timer if it starts getting too bad."
"I find hard to remember what happens in my life. They say that memories are associated with emotions...


As I'm usually numb I don't recall specific details or just vanish on my mind and find hard to recall."
"Almost everything that happened to me when I was deep in depression is only brought back to the surface through some kind of trigger. I can't just recall things, I need to be triggered into remembering them."
"I‚Äôm not on medication, I barely remember anything from 2021 year"
i just can‚Äôt remember almost anything from 1 or 2 years ago or more unless something specific recalls the memory
Same. Whenever I try to do something my body gets so heavy and weak.
"This is exactly what I‚Äôm doing, too. I got a YA book out the library I read when I was 11/12 and it really helped. Hope you're doing okay"
this is 100% where i‚Äôm at right now and it feels so‚Ä¶ blah. like i feel helpless and like there‚Äôs not really much i can do to change the root of the situation. if that makes sense
That explains SO much honestly
a lot to do with the microbiome too
"Ain‚Äôt this the sad truth ü•≤ having anxiety, depression and IBS sucks üò≠"
Dissociation
The positive happy stuff feels so fake
What‚Äôs that supposed to mean?
"YES SAME. I spend time with my fav people but I don't feel anything before, during or after. It's more just making sure to maintain relationships because therapy said it's good for me."
"Felt this so much. I just want to hit the pause button or something, but not end it all."
"If the world could just end tomorrow, that would be great"
Yeah thats the thing. I dont wanna DIE. I dont want to exist. I wish i was never born. That my parents never had to take on the burden that is my mentally ill dumbass.
"Mine is never cured, but it is in remission right now., I am often feeling like I‚Äôm on the knifes edge ready to fall back in the rabbit hole."
"Yes because anxiety usually ties into depression and even if a person doesn't recognize it initially that they're also suffering from anxiety. The feelings of depression take a massive toll on our physical health as well as our mental and emotional. 

It only makes sense that feeling constantly drained, stressed, negative, depleted, overwhelmed, etc. Would do that"
I had scans done one time because I was having such a horrible feeling of irregular or racing heartbeat during an anxiety attack. Definitely counts
"Hi! Ok so not trying to solutionize here but I also hold my depression in my neck and shoulders, and I found this one to be interesting. 

When I‚Äôm depressed, I find I have the tendency to hold my upper body like Eeyore, lol. My chest is caved in, head kinda down, shoulders rolled forward, which results in shortened/tight pec muscles. When we have tight pectoral muscles, it pulls on the neck and the shoulder muscles resulting in strain and pain. 

I‚Äôve been trying to be more cognizant of how I hold space in my body- the mind/body connection also relates to our posture!"
Moodüò∂
"It could very well also be ADHD and it can feed depression, anxiety, and more, but it can also be that depression, anxiety, etc that make you feel very much like you have ADHD 

It‚Äôs a really difficult determination and I have no idea how doctors do it. 

The frustration is real though, you know yourself best but doctors are trying to use a lot of research to get us to feel better. 

Worst case, is you could begin to improve your major symptoms regardless and if you have ADHD it will be easier to diagnose. Or you feel better anyways is my thought. That‚Äôs how I approached it, and it surprisingly worked out. 

I hope you find a path forward that is accessible and brings you up!"
"It can work both ways, I‚Äôm not trying to discount the real problem living with ADHD can be or the reality of it. The system to diagnosis is weird and things are a bit of a mess. 

I just want to encourage people to put a little faith in the considerations a psychiatrist might have. It‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre anti-adhd, but because this above situation happens for a lot of mental illnesses and not treating those will also not fix the symptoms. I was so sure I had it and I have been with a psychiatrist for years who specializes in adhd and anxiety disorders. He had to really explain this. We always settled on ‚Äúonce we have these things under control let‚Äôs revisit adhd‚Äù and sure as heck, here I am no ADHD but feeling way better. 

It‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all taught we have and so we think it has to be why our focus and such is so bad but really, it‚Äôs worth a shot for people who are looking at a diagnosis to tackle some of the other possible causes and you can always come back to a theory after ruling some other things out. Stimulants and anxiety for example can be a bad time, or bipolar disorders, etc. 

I hope you find a path that works for you to tackle some of that depression. It‚Äôs hard."
Yup a ‚Äúfriend‚Äùafter 2 years of not contacting me said ‚ÄúI heard some stuff about you going through so I let you be‚Äù like he was doing something good üòÇüòÇ
"Keep pushing. I kept pushing myself to find new psych professionals and treatments. Eventually, I found the group I'm working with right now that provides people in my area with help navigating life and treatment. I have a case manager, a therapist, a job coach, and my psychiatrist through them. Through a recommendation to a psychologist, I received a Bipolar 2 diagnosis and got on meds for it right away. That much alone has changed my life for the better. I'm no longer a prisoner in my mind, I can control it and understand it SO much better. I got my first job 3 weeks ago with help from my job coach too! I can't even tell you how many different treatments and professionals I went through trying to get to this point though. Keep trying and never stop fighting!‚ù§Ô∏è"
Thanks and yeah my depression started around the same age
"I did an IOP program and I was really nervous about the group aspect of it, but that was actually my favorite part. Talking to other people who actually get it is incredible. Probably the only time I‚Äôve ever been able to be completely candid about all my dark thoughts. If you can get yourself to a support group I definitely recommend it."
It never changes
"Personally, I'll lay in bed for a long time and the main thing I do to pass the time is masturbating. It's a thing that takes no thoughts and gives my brain the feel good hormones. I'm a few days sober of that though so go me"
Oh to who are you talking here. I know im not alone feeling like that.
"Nah, remember this shit buddy, you're the main character here.

Do whatever you think makes you happy and you'll see how far mr depression fucks off to."
"I didn't know EDs have symptoms like these, I'm not diagnosed with an ED and I'm trying my best to eat my daily calories"
It's called flat affect
Anhedonia is another way to describe it.
Or anhedonia. Anhedonia is the inability to experience joy or pleasure. You may feel numb or less interested in things that you once enjoyed.
"That‚Äôs the term for it, though numb works too! It‚Äôs specifically when u r just void of emotion, interest, and/or concern"
"Hahaha yeah it‚Äôs just sleeping but then again I need to push myself not to live in my dreams because reality is where I want to thrive. Medication and therapy and assessing my surrounding and habits usually gets me out of it. HOWEVER, I sometimes wait until I can‚Äôt get out of bed to seek help even though it‚Äôs not my first rodeo!"
PS: sobbing and letting it all out - breakdowns are truly SO refreshing!!
I‚Äôm not BP I have BPD in remission but that doesn‚Äôt affect my sleep one bit. I have ADHD so I struggle to go to sleep but once I‚Äôm asleep I sleep my good 9 hours but it‚Äôs so easy to keep going
Interesting. May have been different type of drug. I took ssri
"Do you say ‚Äústarts getting too bad‚Äù like it makes you late for things or ‚Äústarts getting too bad‚Äù because you feel like you‚Äôre not ~supposed~ to shower for long periods? Either way, it‚Äôs incredibly admirable that you have the wherewithal to notice that you need some external check system and set yourself to be successful. Kudos to you!"
"I‚Äôm doing alright, could be better, could be worse. I hope you are okay too, my friend. :)"
That all others apply. Except for physical self harm.
As long as I get a heads up so I can tell my mom how much I love her.
Agreed my friend. But on another note- happy birthday!
"Just don't forget all the tools you've gathered along the way. 

I know it's absolutely terrifying, but knowing that gives some peace of mind."
"Fuck same here.  I‚Äôll be doing well and then the depression videos start showing up on my IG feed.  It‚Äôs like the AI is saying ‚Äúhell no motherfucker, you‚Äôre still here‚Äù.  I really need to delete that shit."
"Definitely what I do as well! I strain them so much by doing this‚Ä¶ my head drops so easily when I‚Äôm embarrassed, traumatized, depressed, feeling shame, anxiety, etc. I notice how fast it happens‚Ä¶ even in public when someone does something to hurt me, my posture literally drops. The phrase ‚Äúkeep your head held high‚Äù and ‚Äúkeep your chin up‚Äù make so much more sense now as an adult. I‚Äôve physically felt my head drop when I feel negative emotions. 

I‚Äôm trying to correct it and straighten myself up more. Sometimes I won‚Äôt notice it for hours and then when I finally straighten out, my literal collar bone will crack üò≥"
"Oh for sure! I completely agree. It‚Äôs just interesting *knowing* that is absolutely where my depression/anxiety stems from. I‚Äôve always been able to manage my ADHD fairly well, but the last year was *rough* and my avoidant tendencies got the best of me, resulting in depression and anxiety I‚Äôve generally been able to avoid. 

Sending good vibes your way! ü´∂üèº"
"I will! I am really glad you feel better and I will try to enjoy my time as a teen, and hopefully I will be able to feel as good as the rest. It will all work out hopefully, I can't do this on my own. Thank you so much for your advice, I wish you the best ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"You are right, that's why at work I befriended the only colleague who is also depressed. Nobody gets me and validates me more than her. I'm glad you were able to find a safe space to vent too!"
I relate so badly lol although I have a fiance üòÖ
You lose your hair because you don't consume much vitamins and protein and you feel cold because you have no fat. My girlfriend has anorexia so I know these symptoms.
"This is the medical term and I‚Äôve definitely experienced it. It‚Äôs an interesting place to be, arguably better than being explicitly suicidal and suffering, but it‚Äôs not happy either. Unfortunately this is sometimes where antidepressants put people :/"
"u/Special-Longjumping

From what I understand, u can still feel emotions like being sad with anhedonia, which is different from actually being void of any emotion. Like I have periods of that too where nothing brings me joy and then I‚Äôm depressed bc nothing is bringing me joy. But when I‚Äôm apathetic I‚Äôm actually vibin bc it‚Äôs like ‚Äúnothing matters lol‚Äù I‚Äôm not sad nor am I happy I‚Äôm just *existing*"
Thank you very much!! üôÇ
In another post the person is literally expressing not being able to reach the rem cycle of sleep. Meh just sleeping. BAH!
"Omg I have ADHD tooü´† I‚Äôm glad ur in remission, and I think I have that same super power kinda. Like I‚Äôll wake up and be like nah more sleep and then go back down and I can just keep doing that until I‚Äôm ‚Äúrecharged‚ÄùüòÇ"
"SSRIs can do the same thing, generally it means ur dosage is too high if mood meds are doing that. I think we also need to consider that I didn‚Äôt have an issue being apathetic prior, I had the opposite where I felt everything way too intensely so I needed something to level me out"
"Thanks, but I had some encouragement from others to start doing it. And yes, I mean ‚Äútoo bad‚Äù as in it‚Äôs making me late for things or I stay in there for an hour or two and have no idea I‚Äôm in there for that long. At that point people start to get angry at you. I also have a problem of accidentally zoning out and sitting on toilet for 15-20 mins. Haven‚Äôt fixed that one. People don‚Äôt like that very much either."
"Same to you! ADHD is largely underdiagnosed and so often comorbid with other illnesses. We definitely need more research into the big picture. 

I hope you are able to find some relief soon! You deserve to heal and hopefully it can improve your ADHD symptoms that bother you as well. The balance is tough since ADHD is largely medication management!"
"Trust me, I have more fat than I need. I'm 25F, 166cm and 100kgüòÇü•≤ but, indeed, I'm vitamin D deficient due to Hashimoto's disease. But I also have comorbid mental health disorders, ADHD and a second one that my psychiatrist has yet to find out, but she suspects depression, bipolar 2, BPD and CPTSD"
"I lucid dream which is so beautiful that I like sleeping so much. My worst symptom is I don‚Äôt eat, stomach shuts down. But sleep? Oh man I dream daily and though it‚Äôs not a solution it helps to feel relief as I don‚Äôt feel depressed when I dream. I listen to sleep cove at night it‚Äôs a great podcast to fall asleep to. But as I say not a solution!!! I have to force myself to drink a smoothie since my stomach doesn‚Äôt want food etc. it sucks to be awake so I work hard on what I need to feel better when I‚Äôm NOT SLEEPING"
Sleeping is so good. Treasure it because a great amount of people don‚Äôt sleep well plus I‚Äôve also had random times I‚Äôve struggled to sleep and it sucks so much. Anywhooo üß° thank you for being so open!
I think vitamin D or maybe some hormones can play a role in hair loss and maybe feel of coldness
Awe i'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad you get your lucid dreams and a way to experience life in less agony.
"I also lose my appetite completely. I started drinking protein meal shakes, not just protein shakes. Look into Huel, it‚Äôs the brand I use. I think it‚Äôs like 300+ calories per shake? Way easier to force it down and provides 40g of protein and a bunch of other calories. Gentle on the tummy with fiber! And digestive enzymes supplements rnt a bad idea, helped me a lot, but talk to ur doctors before starting any of this stuff !!"
"Sleep to avoid real life problems lol. Valid coping mechanism???üôÉ I also know how tough BPD can be, I‚Äôm experiencing similar symptoms due to my comorbid mental illnesses and it‚Äôs not even the actually disorder. I have a friend with it and we talk a lot about what‚Äôs going on so I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôve managed to treat itüíñ"
"I'll check it out again, maybe I need a higher dose of my vitamin D supplement"
